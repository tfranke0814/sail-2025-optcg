Game Overview  \\n1-1. Number of Players \\n1-1-1. Fundamentally, this game is intended to be played by two players , head-to-head. \\nThese rules do not currently support play by three or more players. \\n1-2. Ending the Game \\n1-2-1. The game ends when either player loses the game. When a player’s opponent loses \\nthe game, the player who has not lost wins the game. \\n1-2-1-1. The two defeat conditions are as follows: \\n1-2-1-1-1. When you have 0 Life cards and your Leader takes damage. \\n1-2-1-1-2. When you have 0 cards in your deck. \\n1-2-2. When either player meets a defeat condition, they will lose the game according to \\nthe rule processing at the next time of rule processing. (See 9. Rule Processing) \\n1-2-2-1. If either player ’s Leader takes damage when that player has 0 Life  cards \\nremaining during the game, that player has met a defeat condition. \\n1-2-2-2. If either player has 0 cards in their deck during the game, that player has met \\na defeat condition.'),\n",

Either player may concede at any point during a game. When a player concedes, \\nthey lose immediately and the game ends. \\n1-2-4. A  concession is not affected by any card. Furthermore, concession cannot be \\nforced by any card effect,  and defeat by concession cannot be replaced by any \\nreplacement effect. \\n1-2-5. The effects of some cards may cause a player to win or lose the game.  In such a \\ncase, the player wins or loses during the processing of that effect , and the game \\nends. \\n1-3. Fundamental Principles \\n1-3-1. When card text contradicts the Comprehensive Rules, the  card text takes \\nprecedence over the Comprehensive Rules. \\n1-3-2. If a player is required to perform an impossible action for any reason, that action \\nis not carried out. Likewise, if an effect requires the player to carry out multiple \\nactions, some of which are impossible, the player performs as many of the actions \\nas possible. \\n1-3-2-1. If an object is required to change to a given state, and the object is already in \\nthat state, the object’s state remains the same, and the action is not performed. \\n1-3-2-2. If a player is required to perform an action 0 or a negative number of times \\nfor any reason, that action is not carried out. A request to perform a certain \\naction negative times does not imply performing its opposite action. \\n1-3-3. If a card ’s effect requires a player to carry out an action while a currently active \\neffect prohibits that action, the prohibiting effect always takes precedence. \\n1-3-4. If both players are required to make choice s simultaneously for any reason, the \\nplayer whose turn it is  makes the choice s first. After that player has made their \\nchoices, the other player makes their choices. \\n1-3-5. If a card or rule requires a player to choose a number, unless otherwise specified, \\nthe player must choose a whole number of 0 or greater. Players cannot choose \\nnumbers containing fractions less than 1, or negative numbers. \\n1-3-5-1. If a card or rule specifies a maximum value for a number, such as “up to ...”, \\nas long as no minimum number is specified, the player can choose 0. \\n1-3-6. If a card effect changes information on a card, unless otherwise specified or defined \\nby the rules, numbers on a card cannot contain fractions less than 1. If non-power \\nnumbers would become negative, they are treated as 0, except in cases where the \\ninformation is added to or subtracted from. \\n1-3-7. Power can become a negative value. \\n1-3-7-1. Even if a card’s power becomes a negative value, unless otherwise specified,'),\n",

Unless otherwise specified, card effects are  carried out in the order described on \\nthe card. \\n1-3-9. If card effects require a player to rest a card and set it as active simultaneously, the \\neffect requiring the player to rest the card always takes precedence. \\n1-3-10. Cost and Activation Cost \\n1-3-10-1. Cost refers to a payment that must be made to play a card. A card’s cost is \\nthe number written in its upper left corner. (See 6-5-3-1.) \\n1-3-10-2. Activation cost refers to a payment required to activate a card’s effect. (See \\n8-3.) \\n1-3-11. If both players are instructed to perform some action at the same time according \\nto a card ’s effect, the turn player is to perform the action first, followed by the \\nnon-turn player. \\n \\n2. Card Information \\n2-1. Card Name \\n2-1-1. This is the card’s fixed name. \\n2-1-2.
