Opponent’s Leader Ability (Eustass \"Captain\" Kid):  \\nKid can restand himself once per turn by resting 3 DON!! and trashing a card. This means your opponent can attack twice with their Leader, potentially putting more pressure on your Life or Characters.\\n\\n2. Opponent’s Board (Triple Nami):  \\nYour opponent has three Nami (OP02-036), each with 5000 power. While their ability is mainly for searching {FILM} cards, they can still attack and pressure your Life or Characters. Be cautious if your Life is low or if you have vulnerable Characters.\\n\\n3. Opponent’s DON!! Advantage:  \\nYour opponent has 8 DON!! available, giving them flexibility to power up attacks, use abilities, or play Events. Watch for potential power boosts or defensive Events during your attacks.\\n\\n4. Your Board State:  \\nYou have strong attackers (Zoro Leader, Zoro Character with Rush, Nico Robin, Marco). However, be mindful of overextending, as green decks can have removal or counterplay.\\n\\n5. Nico Robin’s Ability:  \\nIf you attack with Nico Robin and use her ability, you can potentially KO one of the opponent’s Namis (if they have 3000 power or less, but currently they are at 5000). Consider if you can reduce their power or if you should focus on attacking Life.\\n\\nSummary:  \\nBe wary of Kid’s double attack, the potential for multiple Nami attacks, and the opponent’s high DON!! count for counterplay. Plan your attacks carefully and consider holding back a blocker or counter if you expect a strong counterattack next turn.'"

    "'Here are the main things you should be wary of in the current game state:\\n\\n1. **Eustass \"Captain\" Kid Leader Ability**: Your opponent\\'s leader can, once per turn, rest 3 DON!! and trash a card from their hand to set their Leader as active. This means Kid can attack twice in a turn, or attack and then be ready to block or threaten another attack. Be careful not to leave yourself open to multiple attacks, especially if you are low on life.\\n\\n2. **Multiple Nami (OP02-036) Characters**: Your opponent has three Nami (OP02-036) on the field. Each Nami can, when attacking (by resting 1 DON!!), look at the top 3 cards of their deck and add a {FILM} card (other than Nami) to their hand. This can quickly refill their hand and give them access to powerful {FILM} cards, including events or characters that could swing the game.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Multiple Attacks**: With three Nami and Kid, your opponent can attack multiple times in a turn. Even though Nami\\'s power is only 5000, if you are not careful, you could lose several life in one turn, especially if you cannot block or counter enough attacks.\\n\\n4. **Trigger Effects**: When you take damage, remember that your opponent may be trying to push you into activating a [Trigger] effect from your life cards. Be aware of what triggers you have in your deck and how they might affect the game state.\\n\\n5. **Hand Size and Resources**: With Nami\\'s effect, your opponent can increase their hand size and find key cards. If you let them keep all three Nami on the field, they will have a significant resource advantage over time.\\n\\n**Strategic Advice:**\\n- Try to remove at least one or more Nami if possible, to slow down your opponent\\'s card advantage.\\n- Be cautious about overextending, as Kid\\'s double attack can quickly deplete your life.\\n- Plan your counters and blockers carefully, especially if you expect a big turn from your opponent.\\n- Watch your own hand size and resources, as you may need to defend against multiple attacks in a single turn.\\n\\nIf you have any removal or ways to disrupt your opponent\\'s board, now is a good time to use them!'\n"

During the Main Phase, the turn player can rest an active Leader card in their Leader \\narea, or an active Character card in their Character area, to attack an opponent’s Leader \\ncard in their Leader area, or rested Character card in their Character area. When an \\nattack is made, the game proceeds to Battle (see 6-5-6.) and is processed in order from \\nthe Attack Step (see 7-1-1.) to the Damage Step (see 7-1-4.). \\n7-1-1. Attack Step \\n7-1-1-1. Attacks are carried out by the Leader card, or a Character card in the \\nCharacter area. First,  the turn player  declares their attack by resting their  \\nactive Leader card or 1 active Character card. \\n7-1-1-2. The turn player then selects the target of their attack. The target can be either \\nthe opponent’s Leader card or 1 of their rested Character cards in their \\nCharacter area. \\n7-1-1-3. Effects that read [When Attacking] , “when you attack ”, or [On Your \\nOpponent's Attack] activate. \\n7-1-1-4. If, at the end of the Attack Step, the attacking card or the target card for the \\nattack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Block Step \\n(see 7-1-2.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.). \\n7-1-2. Block Step \\n7-1-2-1. The player being attacked can activate the [Blocker] effect of their card only \\nonce during that battle. \\n7-1-2-2. When a [Blocker] is activated, effects that read [On Block] or “when you block” \\nactivate.\\n\\nevent occurs, follow the procedure below. \\n11-1-1-1. If neither player can stop an infinite loop, the game ends in a draw. \\n11-1-1-2. If only one player has the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop \\naction, that player declares how many times they wish to carry out the loop \\naction. Carry out the loop action that many times and finish it at a timing \\nwhen that player can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player cannot \\nchoose to restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all \\ncards in all areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to \\ndo so. \\n11-1-1-3. If both players have the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop action, \\nthe turn player first decides how many times they wish to carry out the loop \\naction. Next, the non-turn player decides how many times they wish to carry \\nout the loop action. Carry out the loop action the fewer of these two times \\nand finish it at a timing when the player  who chose the fewer of these two \\ntimes can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player s cannot  choose to \\nrestart the loop even if the game is in exa ctly the same state (all cards in all \\nareas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to do so. \\n11-2. Revealing Cards \\n11-2-1. When a card is required to be moved from one secret area to another secret area, \\nsuch as “Add Monkey.D.Luffy from your deck to your hand”, the card being\\n\\n(see 7-1-3.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.). \\n7-1-3. Counter Step \\n7-1-3-1. Effects of the player being attacked that read “when attacked” activate. \\n7-1-3-2. The player being attacked may perform the following actions in any order and \\nas many times as they wish: \\n7-1-3-2-1. Activate [(Symbol) Counter ]: The player being attacked may trash a \\nCharacter card with  [(Symbol) Counter] from their hand to activate an \\neffect that increases the power of their Leader or 1 Character card by the \\nvalue of the [(Symbol) Counter] during that battle. \\n7-1-3-2-2. Activate an Event card: The player being attacked may pay the cost of an \\nEvent card with [Counter] in their hand, and then trash it to activate the \\n[Counter] effect. \\n7-1-2-3. If, at the end of the Counter Step, the attacking card or the target card for \\nthe attack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Damage \\nStep (see 7-1-4.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).  \\n7-1-4. Damage Step \\n7-1-4-1. Compare the power of the attacking card and the card being attacked. If the \\npower of the attacking card is greater than or equal to the power of the card \\nbeing attacked, the battle is won, and the result is either 7-1-4-1-1. or 7-1-4-\\n1-2., depending on the category of the card being attacked. \\n7-1-4-1-1. If a Leader card: 1 damage is dealt to that Leader. \\n7-1-4-1-1-1. If the opponent has 0 Life at the point when it is determined that \\ndamage will be dealt, the attacking player wins the game.\", name='rulebooks_retriever', id='737ea512-33e8-4961-9911-04bbe1ee966f', tool_call_id='call_Pkypz3LGzEawHN1Ar9Y1BZ6X'),\n",
       "  AIMessage(content='Here’s how you should approach attacking your opponent, based on the rules and your current board:\\n\\n1. **Assess Your Board and Opponent’s Board:**\\n   - You have three Characters (Roronoa Zoro [Rush], Nico Robin, Marco) and your Leader (Roronoa Zoro).\\n   - Your opponent has three Nami (all 5000 power) and their Leader (Eustass \"Captain\" Kid).\\n   - None of your opponent’s Characters have [Blocker], so you can attack their Leader directly or attack their rested Characters (if any).\\n\\n2. **Maximize Your Power:**\\n   - Attach 1 DON!! to your Leader to activate Roronoa Zoro’s ability: all your Characters gain +1000 power this turn.\\n   - You can also attach additional DON!! to your Characters to further boost their power for attacks.\\n\\n3. **Attack Sequence Recommendation:**\\n   - **Attack with Characters first:** Use your Characters to attack the opponent’s Leader. Since all your Characters will have at least 6000 power (with Zoro’s ability and 1 DON!! each), they will be strong enough to pressure the opponent’s hand or life.\\n   - **Use Roronoa Zoro [Rush]:** This card can attack the turn it is played. Use it to attack the Leader for immediate pressure.\\n   - **Nico Robin’s effect:** Her [When Attacking] effect only works on Characters with 3000 power or less, but all opponent’s Characters are 5000, so this effect won’t be useful right now.\\n   - **Attack with your Leader:** After attacking with your Characters, attack with your Leader as well.\\n\\n4. **Target Selection:**\\n   - Since your opponent’s Nami are all 5000 power and not rested (unless they attacked last turn), you can only attack their Leader directly.\\n   - If your opponent rests a Nami to attack or use its effect, you could attack and potentially KO it on your next turn.\\n\\n5. **DON!! Management:**\\n   - You have 7 DON!! available. Distribute them to maximize your attacks:\\n     - 1 DON!! to your Leader (to activate the ability).\\n     - 1 DON!! each to your Characters to boost their power.\\n     - Any remaining DON!! can be used to further boost attacks or play cards from your hand.\\n\\n6. **Goal:**\\n   - Try to deal as much damage to the opponent’s Leader as possible, reducing their life and forcing them to use cards from their hand to defend.\\n\\n**Summary of Attack Steps:**\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to your Leader to activate the ability.\\n- Attach DON!! to your Characters to boost their power.\\n- Attack the opponent’s Leader with your Characters and Leader in any order.\\n- If you have cards in hand to play, consider playing more Characters to increase your board presence.\\n\\nIf you want a more detailed, card-by-card attack plan, let me know how many cards you have in hand and if you want to play any new cards this turn!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 633, 'prompt_tokens': 4210, 'total_tokens': 4843, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 2944}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_799e4ca3f1', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BwxY4NxVAWmPRKQaK4H5MlHITRsJA', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='RulebookAgent', id='run--4d8316a6-a3f5-4efe-b630-7e3def98247f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4210, 'output_tokens': 633, 'total_tokens': 4843, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 2944}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}"
