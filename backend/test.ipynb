Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates. | Image credit: Dicebreaker\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### How to build a One Piece Card Game deck\\n\\nTo build a One Piece Card Game deck, first you will need to choose a leader card. These cards typically represent some of One Piece’s most iconic characters, such as Monkey D. Luffy.\\n\\nOnce you have chosen a leader, you can build your main deck. Your One Piece Card Game deck must include exactly 50 cards. These cards must be the same colour as your leader card. (Your leader card does not count as part of your main deck.) If a leader card has multiple colours, it is treated as both of those colours, allowing multiple colours to be included in the deck.\\n\\nNo more than four copies of the same card, as determined by their card number, are allowed to be included in the same deck. One Piece Card Game card types include character cards, event cards and stage cards, in six colours: red, green, blue, purple, black and yellow.\\n\\nAre you going to see Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves?\\n\\n10,949 votes \\n\\nYes, I\\'m really excited!\\n\\n \\n\\nMaybe, I\\'m on the fence\\n\\n \\n\\nNo, I\\'m not interested\\n\\n Vote\\n\\nAs well as your leader card and deck, you will need to create a separate DON!! deck that contains exactly 10 DON!! cards. These cards are effectively the same in terms of gameplay effect - although they may have different artwork - and are used to pay for other cards, activate effects and boost the power of your characters and leader during attacks.\\n\\n![Image 8: A fan of random One Piece Card Game cards, including a selection of characters.](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-cards-fan.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nYour deck must have 50 cards matching your leader\\'s colour (or colours!) | Image credit: Dicebreaker\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### One Piece Card Game setup\\n\\n1.   Shuffle your deck and DON!! deck.\\n2.   Place your deck and DON!! Deck facedown in their respective areas. Your DON!! deck is placed on the left of your field, with your main deck to the right - leave a space below it for your trash/discard pile.\\n3.   Between your DON!! Deck and trash pile is what’s known as your cost area. This is where DON!! cards will be placed as they are drawn. DON!! cards are used to pay for character cards, effects and to boost your other cards’ power.\\n4.   Place your leader card to the left of your deck, leaving a space between the two for your stage card.\\n5.   Above your leader, stage card area and deck is the character area, where any played character cards should be placed during the game.\\n6.   Decide which player will go first. The official One Piece Card Game rules recommend using rock-paper-scissors, or another method. The winner chooses whether they want to go first or second.\\n7.   Each player draws five cards from the top of their deck. Each player may mulligan once by shuffling their entire hand back into their deck and drawing another five cards from the top.\\n8.   Place a number of cards equal to the life value of your leader - which can be seen in the bottom-right corner - in a facedown pile in your life area, above your DON!! deck. You can’t look at or reorder the cards in your life area.\\n9.   You’re ready to play, starting with the first player. (Be sure to take note that the first player will not draw a card during their first turn, and only draws a single DON!! card on their first turn.)\\n\\n![Image 9: The starting setup for the One Piece Card Game, showing cards in their correct positions on the official play mat.](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-gameplay-layout-setup.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nAfter setup and a few rounds, your layout should look a bit like this - with characters up top, your leader card in the middle next to your deck, and DON!! cards at the bottom next to your discard pile. | Image credit: Dicebreaker\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### One Piece Card Game rules\\n\\nTurns in the One Piece Card Game consist of five key phases:\\n\\n1.   Refresh Phase\\n2.   Draw Phase\\n3.   DON!! Phase\\n4.   Main Phase\\n5.   End Phase\\n\\n#### 1. Refresh Phase\\n\\nThe Refresh Phase is when any “until the start of your next turn” effects end.\\n\\nReturn any DON!! cards attached to your leader and character cards to your cost area. Then, reset any rested cards - signified by turning them 90 degrees sideways, similar to tapping in Magic: The Gathering - to active by turning them upright.\\n\\n#### 2. Draw Phase\\n\\nDraw one card from the top of your deck. The first player skips this step on their very first turn.\\n\\n![Image 10: A fan of don cards in the One Piece Card Game, with one don card under an Usopp character card.](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-don-cards.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nDON!! cards can be spent to play cards, or attached to characters already on the field to boost their power for that turn. | Image credit: Dicebreaker\\n\\n#### 3. DON!! Phase\\n\\nDraw two DON!! cards from your DON!! deck and place them face-up in your cost area. The first player only draws and places a single DON!! card on their first turn. DON!! cards are added to your cost area in an active position, orientated vertically.\\n\\n#### 4. Main Phase\\n\\nThe main phase is where most of the One Piece Card Game’s action happens. Players can perform any combination of the following four actions, in any order and as many times as they like:\\n\\n*   Play a card\\n*   Attach DON!! cards\\n*   Use card effects\\n*   Attack\\n\\n**Play a card**\\n\\nTo play a card from your hand, rest DON!! cards in your cost area (by turning them 90 degrees sideways, like tapping in Magic: The Gathering). The number of cards you rest must be equal to the card’s cost, as noted in the top-left corner.\\n\\nCharacter cards and stage cards remain on the field once played; character cards are placed above your leader and deck, while stage cards are placed between your leader and deck.\\n\\nEach player can have only a single stage card in effect at one time; when you play a new stage card, discard the existing stage card to your trash pile.\\n\\nCharacters cannot attack on the turn they are played, or on each player’s first turn. Event cards activate immediately before being discarded to your trash.\\n\\n![Image 11: Three different card types from the One Piece Card Game: a stage (Thousand Sunny), event (Guard Point) and character (Tony Tony Chopper)](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-card-types.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nCharacters and stage cards remain on the field, while events are normally discarded as soon as their effect has activated. | Image credit: Dicebreaker\\n\\n**Attach DON!! cards**\\n\\nDON!! cards that have not been rested - in other words, they are still active as signified by being orientated upright - can be attached to your leader or another character.\\n\\nEach DON!! card adds +1000 power to the attached character. Multiple DON!! Cards can be attached to a single character.\\n\\nWhen a card with DON!! cards attached leaves the field - for instance, by being defeated - the attached DON!! cards return to your cost area rested (turned 90 degrees sideways).\\n\\n**Use card effects**\\n\\nCharacter cards and your leader can use the effects listed in their card text. Card effects may require specific conditions, as listed on the card:\\n\\n*   **DON!! xX:** This effect requires the card to have at least X number of attached DON!! cards to activate.\\n*   **DON!! -X:** This effect requires the player to return X number of DON!! cards from their field (either attached to a leader or character card or in the cost area) to their DON!! deck.\\n*   **Activate (Main) (X):** This effect can be activated during the Main Phase by resting X number of active DON!! cards in your cost area. (By turning them sideways, similar to paying a card’s cost.)\\n\\n![Image 12: Roronoa Zoro\\'s leader card in the One Piece Card Game.](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-leader-card-zoro.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nYour leader begins the game on the table, and must be defended from enemy attacks if you hope to win. | Image credit: Dicebreaker\\n\\n**Attack**\\n\\nAttacking is the main way that players move towards victory in the One Piece Card Game, by attacking their opponent and aiming to reduce their life to zero.\\n\\nWhen attacking, players can choose to target their opponent’s leader or a rested character controlled by their opponent. Each player cannot attack on their first turn, and characters can’t attack on the same turn they are played. (Similar to Magic: The Gathering’s summoning sickness rule.)\\n\\nTo attack with your leader or a character, rest the active card by turning it 90 degrees sideways and announce your target. You can target your opponent’s leader or one of their rested characters. Resolve any “When Attacking” effects once you have chosen a target.\\n\\nIf a card has a Blocker ability, it now activates; the keyword allows an active card with the Blocker keyword to be rested to take the place of another card being attacked. The defending player can then choose whether to play a Counter card from their hand, trashing a character card in order to add the specified Counter value to the defending card\\'s power or an event card to activate the effect as explained on the card.\\n\\n![Image 13](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-shanks-card-top.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nEach card\\'s cost can be seen in the top-left corner, with its value in the top-right. | Image credit: Bandai\\n\\nOnce any effects have been resolved, the power values of the two cards are compared. (Remember that each attached DON!! card adds +1000 power.) A card’s power value can be found in its top-right corner. If the attacker’s power is greater than or equal to the card it is attacking, the attack is successful.\\n\\nIf a leader is attacked successfully, the defending player takes one damage by adding a card from their life area to their hand by drawing from their facedown pile in the life area. If the drawn card has a Trigger effect, the card may be revealed to activate the Trigger effect. If a player takes damage but no cards are left in their life area, they lose the game.\\n\\nIf a character is attacked successfully, the defending card is KO’d and discarded to the player’s trash pile.\\n\\nIf a card successfully defends against an attack, nothing happens - no player takes damage or loses any cards.\\n\\n#### 5. End Phase\\n\\nDuring the End Phase, all effects that are active \"during this turn\" are ended. After that, play passes to your opponent for their turn.\\n\\n![Image 14](https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/one-piece-card-game-charlotte-cracker-card-bottom.jpg?width=690&quality=70&format=jpg&auto=webp)\\n\\nTrigger effects can be activated when a card is drawn from your life area. | Image credit: Bandai\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### How to win the One Piece Card Game\\n\\nTo win the One Piece Card Game, you must reduce your opponent’s life to zero by successfully attacking their leader card.\\n\\nWhen a player would take damage from a successful attack on their leader and has no more cards to draw from their life area, they lose.\\n\\nA player also loses if their deck runs out - as soon as there are zero cards left in your deck, you lose.\\n\\nIf both players suffer defeat at the same time, the game is a draw instead.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### One Piece Card Game keywords explained\\n\\n*   **Banish:** When the opponent suffers life damage, the card from their life area is discarded to their trash area instead of going in their hand. Any Trigger effects are ignored.\\n*   **Blocker:** Allows the card to be rested to take the place of another card being attacked\\n*   **Counter:** Counter effects can be activated when you are attacked, after a target is selected and any Blocker effects have been resolved. The Counter effect allows a character card to be trashed to add the specified value to the defending card\\'s power, or an event to activate the effect as detailed on the card.\\n*   **Double Attack:** Deal two damage to the opponent when their leader is successfully attacked, instead of one\\n*   **Rush:** The character can attack on the same turn it’s played\\n*   **Trigger:** Activates when the card is drawn from the life area after a player suffers damage. The card must be revealed to activate the Trigger effect, but you can optionally choose to not reveal the card by not activating the effect.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Can you play the One Piece Card Game with more than two players?\\n\\nThe One Piece Card Game’s official rules are designed to be played with only two players.

With tournaments selling out in seconds and card product flying off the shelves, the hype around this card game is second to none.\\n\\nEsports Illustrated’s One Piece Card Game expert takes players on an in-depth but brief intro into the One Piece Card Game in this how-to-play guide.\\n\\n### How to Build a Deck\\n\\n![Image 8: Jet Pistol card](https://esi.si.com/.image/t_share/MjAxNDA5ODIyNTYwNjI2NjYx/st01-015.jpg)\\n\\nBandai Namco\\n\\nDecks in the One Piece Card Game consist of 50 cards with no more or no less and also one card that starts outside of the main deck called a “Leader”. Leaders act very similarly to “Commanders” from Magic: The Gathering and decks will be built around the leader and their abilities. Another thing of note about One Piece Card Game decks is that decks are color restricted meaning that a deck can only consist of cards with the same color type as a player’s leader. For example, the Monkey D. Luffy leader from the starter deck is Red so any card going into a Monkey D. Luffy deck have to be only red.\\n\\nIn the 50-card main deck players may place any card into their deck as long as it matches the color requirement and can put up to four copies of any one specific card. A lot of cards in the One Piece Card Game will share the same name as another card, rest assured that the restriction isn't based, but instead card number. For example, a player may play four copies of Nami from the first booster set, Romance Dawn and four copies of Nami from the Straw Hat Pirates starter deck.\\n\\n![Image 9: Monkey D. Luffy leader card](https://esi.si.com/.image/t_share/MjAxNDA5ODIyNTYwNjkyMDU2/st01-001.jpg)\\n\\nBandai Namco\\n\\nAs for card types in the One Piece Card Game, there are three types that can be used in a deck. The most common will be characters. These cards will be how players combat the opposition. The next type of card is events which function like spells in other games. Essentially, these cards have a one-time use and then are placed in the Trash with some being used offensively and defensively. And finally, there are stages. These function like Field Spells in Yu-Gi-Oh! And enchantments in Magic: The Gathering. Essentially, these cards stay on the field and provide a continuous effect to the player or players.\\n\\n![Image 10: Dracule Mihawk card](https://esi.si.com/.image/t_share/MjAxNDA5ODIyNTYwNzU3NTky/op01-070.jpg)\\n\\nBandai Namco\\n\\nNot included in the main deck is a separate 10-card “deck” which is known as the Don! Deck. These are simply resource markers that players will use to do different actions in the game. This 10-card deck is the same for every player in every deck but is vital to making the game playable.\\n\\n### Turn Order in Once Piece Card Game\\n\\nNow that players understand how to build a deck, it's time to play the actual game. The object of the game is to reduce the enemy’s leader’s health to zero and then land a finishing blow. Once a player takes a direct hit while at zero life, they lose.\\n\\nAt the start of the game, players will decide who will go first or second and then draw five cards from the top of their deck. At this point, players may take a one-time mulligan in which they shuffle their hand into their deck and draw a new five-card hand. After both players complete this process, they will take the top cards of their deck up to the health of their leader and place them face down in the life area. Certain leaders have lower health than others with a majority having four or five life.\\n\\n![Image 11: How to play once piece card game](https://esi.si.com/.image/t_share/MjAxNDA5ODIyODI5MDYxOTc2/placement-one-piece-card-game.jpg)\\n\\nBandai Namco\\n\\nAfter this, the game begins. At the start of each turn, the turn player will take a card from their Don! Deck and place it into their Don! area. But after the first turn from the first player, at the start of every turn after, players will produce two cards from their Don! Deck every turn until they reach 10. These cards are how players will pay for the cost of abilities, to activate events or play characters from their hand onto the field. But Don! Has another critical use, players can alternatively attach Don! To their character or leader to boost their attack power for the turn which introduces a unique mechanic to the resource system in the game.\\n\\nAs for how combat works, players may attack with characters the turn after they are played (characters unless otherwise stated, can't attack the turn they are played) and with their leader on any turn past the first turn for each player. Characters and leaders have a power value in the top right of the card which will be used for their attack power and their defense power. In combat, players will compare the power of the characters in combat. If the attacking character has more power than the defending character, they are KO’d and put into the Trash. If a character or leader attacks the enemy leader and the power of the attacker is greater than the defending leader, the defending player will take a card from their life area and add it to their hand.\\n\\nHowever, the defending player may counter out of attacks. Many characters will have a “counter” text box on the side of the card. When a player is under attack, they can discard any number of cards in their hand with counter to give the defending character or leader extra power to defend with. If a character or leader attacks a character or leader that has more power after the counter step, the attack fizzles and nothing happens. One key thing to note is that characters can only attack other characters that are “rested”. Attacking with a character or using certain abilities will rest a character leaving them open to being attacked.\\n\\nThe turn itself is fluid meaning that a player can attack with a character and then play another character and attack with their leader all in one continuous phase. Once a player has no more actions to perform, The turn ends and the next player starts their turn by drawing a card, restanding their rested characters and Don! Cards, gain an additional two Don! Cards from their Don! Deck and then proceed with their turn. This continues until one player wins.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nPublished Oct 10, 2023\\n\\n![Image 12: Warren Younger](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_180,ar_1:1,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/warren-11cceee2ab7427a4673ad4aa6f5f84dc.jpg)\\n\\n[WARREN YOUNGER](https://www.si.com/esports/author/warren-younger)\\nWarren is classicaly trained esports Journalist with a Sports Journalism degree from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University.

The July 2025 Forbidden and Limited List for Asian English is here—and it’s shaking things up in a big way. While Ryzeal took a hard hit with the limits to Ext Ryzeal and Sword Ryzeal, one of the biggest shocks was the sudden fall of Abyss Dweller, going from unlimited straight to forbidden. With DUELIST ADVANCE just around the corner, let’s explore the decks that are about to define this new AE format—and maybe even help you climb that next local or regional ladder. July 2025 Asian English List Here’s a quick snapshot of the July 1, 2025 AE list:  「NEWLY FORBIDDEN」 Abyss Dweller (3 ⇒ 0) Kaiser Colosseum (1 ⇒ 0) Summon Limit (1 ⇒ 0) 「NEWLY LIMITED」 Dimension Shifter (3 ⇒ 1) Ext Ryzeal (3 ⇒ 1) Sword Ryzeal (3⇒ 1) Bonfire (2 ⇒ 1) 「SEMI-LIMITED」 Fiendsmith Engraver (3 ⇒ 2) PSY-Framegear Gamma (3 ⇒ 2) Fiendsmith’s Tract (3 ⇒ 2) Gold Sarcophagus (3 ⇒ 2) Top AE Decks to Try This Format 1. Maliss Untamed. Unhinged. Unstoppable? With just a tiny slap on the wrist to Gold Sarcophagus, Maliss remains at full throttle. Apollousa still reigns in AE, and the engine runs scary smooth. Expect to see Maliss dominate unless players come prepared—with Artifact Lancea and Chaos Hunter locked and loaded. View all “Maliss” cards here.  2. Atlantean Mermail With Abyss Dweller gone, this water army is flowing freely again. From OTK options to brutal “hand-rip” setups thanks to Moulinglacia, Mermail may just make waves again. Don’t be surprised if it floods your local meta. View all “Atlantean” cards here. View all “Mermail” cards here.  3. Blue-Eyes An iconic pick—and a personal favorite. The Primite build has real staying power even in a Maxx “C”-infested world. Set it up right, and Blue-Eyes can still drop a board that screams, “Try breaking this!” View all “Blue-Eyes” cards here.  4. Crystron Crystron Halqifibrax is alive and well here in AE, and Crystron makes the most of it. With flexible Synchro lines and combo routes into Cyber Dragon Infinity, it’s a thinking man’s toolbox deck that rewards precision and grind game mastery. View all “Crystron” cards here.  5. Yubel Once trampled by Ryzeal’s Detonator and Dweller, Yubel’s time to shine might just be now. The Fiendsmith variant is poised for a comeback, and its layered strategy and board disruption make it a thrilling underdog pick. View all “Yubel” cards here.  6. Vanquish Soul Incoming consistency bump via DUELIST ADVANCE, and then a potential turbo-mode with Justice Hunters in August (hello K9 engine). If you\\'re looking to invest early into a sleeper deck with lots of room to grow, VS might be it. View all “Vanquish Soul” cards here.  7. White Forest Azamina A solid all-rounder. Good end boards, solid recovery, and steady consistency. While not flashy, it’s the kind of deck that rewards smart play and punishes sloppy opponents. Plus, it\\'s still relatively off-meta, giving it the element of surprise. View all “White Forest” cards here 8. Rescue-Ace Despite some Fiendsmith tuning via semi-limits to Engraver and Tract, Rescue-Ace hasn’t lost its fire. With all its core cards intact and explosive first-turn setups, it’s still one of the strongest go-first decks out there. View the “Rescue-Ace Tactical Try Deck” here 9. Sky Striker Still flying high. With fresh boosts coming in DUELIST ADVANCE, Striker gains that extra spark in both consistency and aggression. OG pilots will love the support, and curious newcomers may find a new waifu in Raye. View all the “Sky Striker” cards here.  10. Ryzeal It’s down—but not out. Seventh Tachyon is still unlimited, and the new Onomat support could breathe fresh life into the archetype. For spice? Mix in the Shark Engine with Surfacing Big Jaws and Drake Shark, or tech in Small World for consistency patches. View all “Ryzeal” cards here. Final Thoughts Sure, this list feels like déjà vu for some—closely mirroring certain OCG trends. But there’s still plenty of room to carve out a unique path. Some decks remain untouched, and that’s an opportunity. At the end of the day, nothing beats jamming with a deck you know inside-out and love piloting. Got your favorite picked out yet?

But once you’ve played a few rounds, you might start asking—where do I go from here? This guide walks you through the essential upgrades that can elevate your deck from off-the-shelf to locals-ready in no time. What You’re Working With Below, you’ll see the contents of TACTICAL TRY DECK: Rescue-Ace. Right out of the box, Rescue-ACE gives you a taste of battlefield control. Cards like Alert, Contain, and Turbulence help you set the tempo with quick-play recursion and trap negates, while Hydrant anchors the strategy as the heart of your emergency operations. Add in the reprints like Ash Blossom, Maxx “C”, and Infinite Impermanence, and you’ve got solid foundations—but real power comes from customization. Tech Cards and Engines to Explore To supercharge your Rescue-ACE deck, consider integrating these high-impact engines and tech options. Each one brings something unique—whether it’s opening lines, protecting your win conditions, or dodging disruptive hand traps. 1. Fiendsmith Engine A rising favorite for control-style builds, the Fiendsmith engine brings protection and pressure. Fiendsmith Desirae acts as in-theme disruption, offering quick negation while also providing Link fodder for Promethean Princess or Apollousa. Plus, this engine creates bait windows early in your turn—drawing out hand traps so your Turbulence setup resolves cleanly. What you need: · 2-3 Fiendsmith Engraver · 1 Lacrima the Crimson Tear · 1-2 Fiendsmith Tract · 1 Fiendsmith’s Requiem · 1 Fiendsmith’s Sequentia · 1 Fiendsmith’s Desirae · 1 Fabled Lurrie · 1 Fiendsmith’s Lacrima 2. S:P Little Night Arguably the strongest generic Link monster available today, S:P Little Night is a dream support piece for Rescue-ACE. Its banish effect not only disrupts your opponent mid-combo but also shields Turbulence from targeting negates. When sequenced properly, it ensures you can resolve your trap-setting effects uninterrupted—key to snowballing advantage. 3. Sinful Spoils Engine If consistency is what you crave, this engine delivers. With just Diabellestar the Black Witch, Original Sinful Spoils Snake-Eye, and WANTED: Sinful Spoils Hunter, you gain near-instant access to Rescue-ACE Hydrant. 4. PSY-Frame Gamma Engine Still unlimited in the Asian English card pool, the Gamma package is a nasty surprise for your opponent. It cleanly shuts down Ash Blossom, Maxx “C”, or Mulcharmy Fuwalos/Purulia, letting your power cards resolve while offering bonus bodies for Link climbing. Final Thoughts Upgrading Rescue-ACE isn’t about going all-in on high rarity staples—it’s about finding the right engines that mesh with the archetype’s strengths: versatility, reactivity, and timing. These engines don’t just patch weaknesses—they empower Rescue-ACE to play on its terms, no matter the matchup. Got a combo line or spicy tech of your own? Let the community know—we’re all ears and Emergency! buttons. This has been ArcKnight of RespectYGO.

Once you get the combos down, this deck feels fast, fluid, and oppressive against graveyard-heavy strategies. This guide covers key combos, strategic play tips, and even a potential future card that could take Exosister to the next level. Let’s dive in! Essential Exosister Combo 1. Aratama Setup (Fast Route to Magnifica) Starting Hand: Aratama or Exosister Stella + 1 Level 4 Exosister (or extender like Sakitama) 1. Normal Summon Aratama → Search Sakitama 2. Use Sakitama’s effect → Normal Summon it 3. Overlay into Exosister Kaspitell → Search Exosister Martha 4. Special Summon Martha & Elis using Martha’s effect 5. Overlay into Exosister Mikailis → Search Exosister Returnia for interruption 6. Overlay Kaspitell & Mikailis → Make Exosister Magnifica This setup delivers solid search power, disruption with Returnia, and a Magnifica ready to banish threats. 2. Classic Martha Opening (Quick Turn-One Setup) Starting Hand: Martha + Any Exosister Monster 1. Summon Martha → Special Elis 2. Overlay into Exosister Mikailis → Search Pax or Returnia 3. If needed, activate Pax → Search Stella or Elis to prep for the next turn 4. Set Returnia → Banish up to two cards when needed 5. If the opponent activates a graveyard effect → Mikailis + Elis trigger an instant Magnifica upgrade This opening stabilizes the board while ensuring a big disruption play on your opponent’s turn. 3. Stella Extension Play (XYZ into Magnifica) Starting Hand: Exosister Stella + Any Level 4 Monster (or extender like Sakitama) 1. Normal Summon Stella → Use her effect to special summon an Exosister monster from your hand (or use Sakitama to drop another Level 4) 2. Overlay into Exosister Kaspitell → Search Martha 3. Special Summon Martha & Elis 4. Overlay into Exosister Mikailis → Search Returnia or Pax 5. Overlay Mikailis & Kaspitell → Make Exosister Magnifica This combo snowballs quickly, making it easy to build a strong board with minimal resources. 4. Vadis Trap Play (Instant Reaction to Opponent’s Graveyard Moves) Starting Hand: Vadis Set + Any Exosister Opponent activates a graveyard effect Activate Vadis → Special Summon two Exosisters from the deck Immediately XYZ into Mikailis or Kaspitell, depending on the matchup If needed, search Returnia for even more interruption power Next turn, upgrade into Magnifica for complete board control When timed right, this wrecks graveyard-heavy decks, forcing them to rethink their plays. Tips for Playing Exosister · Know when to use Aratama or Exosister Martha – Martha is powerful, but remember she can only be special summoned if you don\\'t control a non-Exosister monster. Don\\'t misplay by locking yourself out of her effect. · Protect your board when going first – Side deck Solemn Judgment or similar counter traps to prevent board wipes and keep your setup intact. · Be smart with your disruption effects – Not every banish is worth it. Study the decks at your locals so you know which cards deserve your Mikailis or Returnia banish. · Practice, practice, practice – The more matchups you play, the better you’ll understand timing, interaction, and outplay opportunities. Mastering the deck means spending less time figuring out your own plays and more time countering your opponent’s strategy. The Future of Exosister: What’s Missing? For this deck to become even better, it needs two things: · A true searcher – Something like Stratos for Exosister that grabs any sister or spell/trap upon summon. This would improve consistency and deck building, removing reliance on Stella or Aratama just to get Martha. · A negate effect – Whether it’s a continuous effect, a boss monster ability, or a counter-trap, Exosister needs a way to protect its board while maintaining its disruption power.

Final Thoughts Exosister brings speed, disruption, and tactical XYZ summons, making it a meta-relevant deck with incredible counterplay potential.

card game was announced and it is currently being played in Japan with plans of an English release happening later this year what's going on y'all my name is Steven I'm your true champion and in today's video we're going to talk about how to play the brand new one-piece card game in this video I plan on teaching you the basic rules as well as the overall flow of the game I will do my absolute best to give you all the pertinent information you need so you can hit the waters running and start your grand line Journey off right if y'all are excited for this video be sure to leave a like And subscribe and comment down below what are you most excited for from the one piece card game I for one love the battle system in this game with how intricate it is both at the beginning of a battle and the end of a battle with that being said we have a lot of rules to go over and not a lot of time let's get started in one piece the goal of each player is to delete your opponent's leader of life and then when they're all out deliver one final finishing blow to win the game you do this by using your own leader and their crew of character cards to constantly attack the opposing leader how do we establish this crew of characters and swashbucklers that we use to destroy our opponent's defenses we use Dawn Dawn cards are the main resource we use to play the game and much like Mana from Magic Don cards are placed in a cost area on the game board and must be turned sideways or rested in order to pay for the costs of cards unlike Magic the Gathering however Dawn cards are guaranteed each and every turn during a specific phase of the game on your turn if you wish to play a card you pay the cost in the upper left hand corner by resting or turning sideways the appropriate number of dawn from the cost area for example let's say I have four Dawn and I want to play a chopper from my hand which has a play cost of three I will simply rest the required amount of dawn from the cost area and then place my Chopper in the character area sometimes cards have other types of costs as well besides play costs and the most confusing are definitely Don X and Don minus X effects Don X effects are effects that can be unlocked if the required amount of dawn is underneath the card let's go back to our Chopper example he has a dawn X1 effect which if I want to be able to use I need to first place an active Dawn from my cost area underneath him from there as always understanding the effect is as simple as just reading the card Don minus XFX are activated when you return the necessary amount of dawn to the bottom of the Dawn deck for example the promo kaido has an activate main Don minus 2 effect that gives him the banish keyword for the turn if I wish to use this effect to gain the banish keyword I need to first take two Dawn cards from my board and place them back in my Dawn deck to put it all simply the more Don you have the the more you can do during your turn the game of one piece is played with a 50 card main deck a 10 card Dawn deck and a leader card which is what everything is built around all cards in your main deck must have at least one color in common with your leader and you can only have a maximum of four copies of any uniquely numbered card alongside that your main deck is made up of character cards event cards and Stage cards character cards are your creatures or your units that you will use to attack and defend your board State these cards all have a play cost in the upper left hand corner which denotes how much Dawn you need to rest in order to play the card in the top right hand corner you can see how much power an individual character has and in the bottom center of the card you can see the name as well as the color of the card event cards are sort of like one use cards that you can activate during the main phase of your turn by paying their Dawn cost and once their effects resolve they are placed in the trash similar to them stagecar cards are also cards that you can play during your main phase but instead of going away they stay in the stage area and they have reusable effects that can be used each turn as of right now you can only have one stage card in play at any one time every single card in your main deck has the potential to have what's called a trigger effect these are effects that can be activated if they are in your life when you have taken damage with your leader these effects cannot be activated from your hand they can only be used when they are revealed as life damage if you wish to activate a trigger effect you simply reveal the checked card to your opponent when you take life damage otherwise you just put the card into your hand each game of One Piece How to Play the Game begins with both players shuffling their main deck and placing their Dawn deck and leader card in their respective areas once you have decided who is going first via Rock Paper Scissors you then draw your opening hand of five cards in one piece if your opening hand is something that you are not happy with you can choose to Mulligan or redraw the same number of cards by taking your initial hand placing it back in the deck shuffling and then drawing a new hand of five cards you can only redraw your opening hand once each game after you have your opening hands you then place the top X cards from your deck face down in the Life area X is denoted in the bottom right hand corner of your leader this is what tells you how much life you have at the beginning of each game once you have your opening hand and your life has been placed it is time to begin there are five phases in one piece the refresh phase the draw phase the Don phase the main phase and the end phase in one piece resting a character is equivalent to suspending or tapping it in other card games and this happens when you attack or block with that card after resting it that card will remain in that state until the refresh phase of your next turn during the refresh phase all cards are put into the active or upright position before any other phases of play can continue during this phase any Dawn cards assigned will go back to the cost area in the active position each turn after the first you will draw one card from the top of your deck there is currently no hand limit in one piece but if your deck Runs Out Of Cards you'll lose the game this is called decking out once the draw phase has concluded you move to the Don phase and this is where you activate two of your Dawn and place them in the cost area each turn to activate a Don you simply turn the top card of your Dawn deck face up and place it in the cost area to be used later the player who is going first only gets one Dawn on their first turn instead of two the main phase is as the name suggests where the bulk of your actions are going to take place during this phase you can do any of the following as you like in any order you can play cards from your hand you can assign active Dawn to characters or leaders you control and you can attack your opponent's rested characters or their leader card you play characters directly onto the character area if you are able to pay their cost by resting the required amount of on from your cost area characters can not attack the turn they are played and each player can only have a maximum of 5 characters in play at any one time if you wish to play a sixth character you must move an existing character you control to the trash First Once you have played some cards and have some leftover Dawn to use you can do what's called assigning Dawn this is where you take a Don that is active from your cost area and place it underneath one of your cards doing this will apply any effects or Buffs to that card that the dawn is underneath currently the only effects available are power plus 1000 during your turn so a signing Dawn can be a very helpful way to make your crew more powerful before they attack once my opponent has no life left one of my favorite plays is to take all the Don that I have place it underneath my leader and do one giant Unstoppable swing to win the game very fun both your leader and character cards are able to attack your opponent's leader regardless of its position but you can only attack your opponent's characters if they are rested you can attack as many times as you like during your main phase with each attack happening one at a time when you declare an attack a battle will take place and during battle there are three sub steps that occur the block step the counter step and the Damage step the block step is where you can redirect any attacks that are meant for one character or leader to a blocker that you have in play who has the blocker ability you do this by resting the Blocker in your character area and making it the new Target of the attack note the character card must be active in order to block you can only block one card at a time you cannot double block and once blocks have either been declared or skipped you enter What's called the counter step the counter step or as I like to call it the defense step is where the defending player has the ability to increase the battle power of their crew by using cards in their hand some cards have counter effects either in the form of stats on the left side of the card or actual effects that can be played during this step of the game if you wish to use a counter you simply place it in the trash during the counter step you could use as many or as few cards as you like during the counter step in order to calculate counterpower you simply add together the total amount of counters used then apply it to the defending card's power in this example Luffy has 5000 base power and I'm using 3 000 worth of counterpower so at the end of the counter step Luffy has 8 000 power in total one more time the counter step is only for the person who is being attacked not for the person who's attacking if you wish to make your character more powerful before they attack I recommend Using Dawn the damage step is the final step of battle where the attacker and Defenders powers are compared if the attacker's power is less than the defender the attacker loses the battle and nothing happens if the attacker's power is greater than or equal to the defender's power the attacker wins and one of two things will happen if a character card was attacked it'll be ko'd and placed in the trash if the leader was attacked the defender looks at the top card of their life deck and adds it to their hand this is what taking life damage looks like and again any trigger effects will happen here and nowhere else a lot of strategy in one piece comes down to mastering battle as it's the easiest way to lose out on cards either in play or in hand so definitely make sure you're not countering too much or blocking too much sometimes taking a free life card and adding it to your hand can be a good thing once you have done all that you wanted to do during the main phase you simply go into the end phase and pass the turn back to your opponent in order to win the game and claim the one piece for yourself you must clear your opponent of life and deliver one final gum gum rocket to finish them off if you want to play the one piece card game there is a tutorial app available in the app and Google Play stores where you can use the official starter decks and go over all the rules we went through today definitely be sure to also check out the official one piece website down below in the description for the complete English rulebook as well as a very helpful q a links to everything I just said down below and yeah with all that being said I bring your true champion Stephen be sure to leave a like And

A bit of a cheap indicator of a game's continued success as most card games fail\\nto make it that long. Not only has one piece\\nmade it through five sets, they've made it through absurdly well,\\nbecoming a consistent fourth on the top selling card games\\nonly behind the Big three. Yugioh, Magic, and Pokemon. In fact, Individual\\none piece sets have been outperforming the average set for Magic The gathering\\nand Yugioh. While, impressive. This really says a lot more\\nabout the decline and quality of these two games\\nthan it does with one piece's success. This video seeks to analyze and review\\nhow the one piece card game has evolved and develop five sets in,\\nas well as covering the wacky developments that have appeared on the distribution\\nand financial side of the game. Without further ado,\\nlet's get into discussing the power creep and the development of mechanics\\nin the one piece card game. Powercreep and The Meta Since its release, the one piece meta has seen two\\nsizable shifts in power creep. The first jump is from set\\none into sets two and three, with the pushing of red\\nand the absurd release of new staples. And the second jump has been from the set\\ntwo and three format in to set five, which gives us our first bit of leader\\npower creep after we fully developed each color identity. All things considered,\\nI feel the power creep in. One piece is okay, Staples transfer\\nover from set to set, strategies get new generic tools very often, and a lot of old\\nleaders are still viable competitively. However, this isn't to say there hasn't been dramatic power creep\\nin the one piece card game. The three meta leaders from OP5\\nSakazuki, Purple Luffy and Enel all start to drive out\\nthe previous meta leaders in their colors by being active drivers of their\\nstrategies instead of just a flavor. Being a driver is why previous\\nmeta decks in the game have been good. Green Eustass Captain Kidd,\\nZoro and Whitebeard all examples of this. But by pushing the colors of black,\\nyellow and purple, the entire game has been pushed forward to compensate.\\nSakazuki, for example, who, just by being ran as your leader,\\nnot only enables and buffs every K.O. card in black and blue,\\nbut it also provides the most hand fixing and draw power in the game compared\\nto the previous options of Smoker and Rob Lucci. Rob Lucci only who only functions\\nas a janky finisher late game. There is no question that the power level\\nin the game has gone up alongside. This has been an increase in removal\\noptions and draw power in general. Yellow now has received 2000 volts\\nand Gedatsu for additional board control. Purple has received even more ramp,\\nletting them actually make use of them before somewhat hard\\nto access, removal and Sakazuki is entirely based around\\nefficient removal. This has shifted the meta\\nto be entirely around a triad of Sakazuki, Enel sometimes Katakuri and purple luffy with a ton of decks\\ncompeting for that fourth place spot. I think it is a slightly above\\naverage format if you play competitively, but it's definitely a bit harder\\nfor rogue decks to handle since you have to optimize for three\\nvery different options. The upcoming meta and set six will most likely give black\\neven more powerful options with the release of the new leader\\nGecko Moria and even more Navy support. If you count all black decks together,\\nit will likely be a tier zero format, which is kind of,\\nI don't know, it's a bit harsh. Basically, Gecko Moria is able\\nto play absurdly efficiently by recurring resources from the graveyard, effectively\\nturning a graveyard into a second hand. It's pretty unhealthy,\\nbut we'll see if people get tired of it. I honestly predict that four cost Rebecca will end up banned or restricted somehow. The One Piece Ban List Speaking of a banned\\nlist, that brings us to our next topic. Bandai’s bad management of the one piece\\nban list. After set two Bandai released a ban this covering\\nsome of the most egregious cards. This would get expanded a bit, but\\nit would do very little to stop an insane red meta in the game that lasted from\\nset two to set four. It only ended\\nbecause Bandai dropped the surprise ban list, hitting an absurd\\nfour cards from the strategy, bringing the total up to eight cards\\nrestricted or banned for red as a color. This decision was kind of terrible\\nas it not only came out of nowhere, but it also hit a ton of cards\\ngetting reprints. I'm talking about in premium\\nspecial order products and main sets as a special rarity\\nand even in a starter deck, the hits also went quite a bit\\nover the line and overdid it, including hitting a generic searcher\\nfor straw hats, which is something that every deck\\njust kind of has. The situation led to players\\nbeing extremely furious with Bandai, even though most people wanted\\nred decks hit in some way. The backlash and more likely cancel orders led to Bandai announcing two weeks later\\nthey would revoke the ban list. With the release of set five, which of course\\nhurt people who panic, sold their decks. In my opinion, panic selling was stupid. But ehh, what can you do? Later, Bandai would surprise people again\\nby revealing that what they meant by revoking the ban list was revoking all cards\\nthat were banned on the banned list. Then they would claim they meant to do\\nthis revoke the entire time. Despite waiting two weeks after\\nthe surprise ban list to announce it. Bandai also claims that this was due\\nto the shift in menu at set five. However, if this is true,\\nBandai really messed up. If Bandai had just claimed that this is\\nwhat they were doing from the start. All of the negative attention the ban list\\ngot really wouldn't have been a thing. Despite the chaos\\ncaused on the secondary market. The ban list doesn't appear\\nto have negatively impacted sales. Set five has sold out completely, as has\\njust about every other one piece product. I do think it's important to note\\nthat the whole fiasco as a whole did show that Bandai was willing to listen\\nto community feedback, even if only in this case, it's something\\nother card game companies have just failed at every opportunity. New Products Following the one piece card games repeated success\\nin selling out. Bandai has moved to release more and more products,\\nall of which have sold very well. But they did have some varying\\ndifferent levels of quality. Set four has been the first set. That's just okay, both financially\\nand in the meta. Again, it's having some lasting impacts\\nwith individual staples, but as a whole, the unique strategies\\nintroduced and supported in the set haven't performed that well. This has followed through\\nwith how these cards have been perceived on the secondary market only recently\\nseeing super rares go above $5 Now that the set is out of print.\\nArt wise, his set introduces these gorgeous sp rares, which are high\\nrarity alt arts of older cards. These are great and the unique styles of\\nart they've shown so far have been great. These SP rares have continued\\ninto set five and will be likely continuing forward\\nin the future. In every case. All original art for\\nthe game has been fantastic. The most notable products Bandai\\nhas been releasing, though, has been this new level of products in between\\nindividual packs and full boxes. To this end, Bandai has begun releasing\\ngift collections, double packs and gum gum fruit collections. Double packs are the best product\\nand easiest to explain. It's a simple two packs\\nwith an additional don!!. It's a great pack\\nall around that I really do recommend. Well, that is if you can find it\\nfor MSRP around $10. This product, along with every other one piece card\\ngame product, has had the same problem. And it's a shame\\nbecause if you can get it, most one piece product is absurdly\\ngood and very quality. Gift collections are a bundle of packs\\nfrom several sets with a deck box and some unique promo packs. This is great and I recommend it. Bandai deck boxes are a bit nicer\\nthan the bushiroad equivalent. Unfortunately, this product is just hard\\nto get a hold of. Lastly, we have the only garbage product\\nof the gum gum fruit, which would be entirely forgettable\\nif it weren't for the exclusive don!! locked to this product. It's a cheap, giant plastic model of a gum\\ngum fruit. It can't fit a deck. The plastic molding is bad enough\\nto make it bad for collectors. And lastly, the value you get for\\nthe price just isn't worth it. Despite all this, the gum\\ngum fruit collection also sold out. We also have the release of three\\nstarter decks since set three starter decks eight and nine are Starter\\nDeck Yamato and starter deck Black Luffy are the weakest starter decks to date\\nand haven't done anything competitively. Starter deck luffy remains the only starter deck that can still\\nsometimes be found at local game stores. I honestly don't hate the Yamato one\\nas it's a fun alternative take for color, that really needs a strategy\\noutside of Big Mom and. Enel if it's not that good, I recommend\\nit. Starter deck ten or the three Captains is the first of a line of new\\npremium starter decks, which means they're all foil. Including the don!!, have three liters\\ninstead of one, come with a deck box\\nand have an increased MSRP of around $30. Overall, it's a great product. They use the alt art\\nfoiling on key cards for the set and have some great reprints,\\nespecially when they're not banned. The increased price tag was actually fine in this case\\nas it's justified for what you're getting, although do note this deck still only\\ngives you two copies of the key cards, so you're still have to buy two. Bandai has still been releasing\\npremium products through their premium Bandai.\\njust for reference Wizards of the Coast. This is how you should do secret\\nlairs. 12 cards, all foils\\nfor $30 with meaningful reprints. Not five mechanically unique\\ncards, non foiled for $40. OP5 and its Distribution This brings us to the release of set\\nfive of one piece today. This is the most successful set of one\\npiece, maybe tied with the first set. It's the first major meta shift since OP2 and has a ton of new cool\\nsupport for every color. Plus, it sold out almost immediately. There's something funny going on here. For some reason, the ordered numbers\\nof set five by game stores was cut. We don't know the exact details, but it was promised that the cut orders\\nwould be sent out later. This led to a ton of stores\\nnot being able to fulfill preorders and most stores,\\nnot having any extras to sell regularly. Why this happened is a whole\\nother conversation entirely. Bandai is rumored to have cut distribution\\nto local game stores to make room for Target,\\nWalmart and other big box retailers. It does seem that these stores\\ngot their expected orders, but I really can't prove\\nor disprove this theory. So take it with a big grain of salt. Another theory is that\\nthey're just cutting down on one piece printing to make room\\nfor their new upcoming card games such as the Dragon Ball Card Game Reboot\\nand the new Union Arena. This theory doesn't make sense\\nsince the timing doesn't work out\\nand one piece is just so successful. The last and most likely theory,\\nin my opinion, is artificial. From Konami. Well, sorry. Force of habit. The last and most likely theory, in my opinion,\\nis that all of the scarcity around one piece's product releases is artificial\\nfrom Bandai  to drive sales. Similar to Nintendo with Amiibos\\nor with Beanie Babies. Card games have a massive scalper culture\\nalready and scalpers have played dead in Bandai’s hand leaving the market\\nas a whole to be absurdly inflated. The Inflated Market Man. The one piece card game has been the most absurdly\\ninflated thing I've ever seen. Let me give you some personal examples. Here's an almost max rarity Kin’emon deck\\nI bought for fun and for personal collecting for about $650. It's currently valued at around 2K. I bought my Black Core for Sakazuki for around $150 around the time of set three. I recently sold it for about $600. It's been a similar price increase for\\nevery other deck and card in this game. Why is it like this? Well, part of it has to do with\\nthe scalper culture I mentioned before. There's even a whole Dischord dedicated\\nto doing buyouts publicly in the open. But the bigger answers come from\\nhow much the game has been growing. And Bandai delaying\\nany potential reprints of sets, thus creating the environment\\nfor this to happen in the first place. Older sets, mostly sets one through three have gone out of print\\nhard, capping the supply in the market. However, new players have joined\\nthe game at an unheard of rate, leaving staples from these early sets\\nto rise dramatically. More so with the actually collectible\\nand alternate cards. These prices went even higher\\nwith the announcement of an extra booster pack\\nentirely based around older strategies. Side note here, this side set is the most hyped\\nI've ever been for a product in this game. I'm likely ordering a case. It's a great move from Bandai and\\ndoes so much for the health of the game and making sure\\nevery deck can get support. Bandai has claimed that they will be\\nreprinting sets one and two at some point, but they've been extremely vague\\nas to when that is.\\nBandai has just been vague on everything. My local game store doesn't know\\nhow many copies of the Uta starter deck they're getting yet,\\nso they can't do preorders. The starter deck is releasing\\nin less than a month and it's just a terrible practice\\nfrom Bandai. The market has gone into overdrive\\nand it's inflated the price to play the game to be around\\n$300 to $600 per deck. The Big three,\\nthis format, Enel, Sakazuki, and purple Luffy all go for about $500. It's insane. Since last format he price of\\nthe average deck was about 150. With only a few exceptions. Unlike Yugioh, cards\\ndon't need to be reprinted to fix the incredibly awful\\nrarity system created by Konami. Unlike in Magic cards, don't need to be reprinted\\nbecause they're stupid old in one piece. Cards need to be reprinted because they were never enough\\nprinted in the first place. The problem gets even more out of hand\\nwith the starter decks. What should be an introductory product Now gatekeepers New players from the game, by containing absurdly\\nexpensive out-of-print staples. If you want to play Purple Luffy, you need four copies of $45 Queen,\\nwhich can only be obtained from the $100 starter Deck four,\\nwhich retails for about $15 originally. It's a similar story with starter decks\\ntwo, three, five, six, seven. and it's likely going to be a problem\\nin the future for starter deck ten. Bandai needs to reprint\\nsets and the starter decks. If they want this game to be played\\nby people other than scalpers. I think Bandai’s failures here\\ngo in stark contrast to what one piece as a series is about,\\nbut that is a really cheap shot Mechanically Unique Promos for those of you who've seen my last one,\\nPiece Game review. You know that my biggest complaint at the\\ntime was about the exclusive promo cards. Cards with unique effects that can only be obtained\\nby going to events. Mechanically unique promo cards are terrible\\nfor the game as they needlessly drive up 14 minutes, 2 seconds  deck prices, are actively made inaccessible\\nto most players, and incentivize scalpers to spam enter\\ninto as many events as possible. Well, I'm here to report that promo exclusive cards\\nhaven't really gotten that much better. First of all, all the older promo\\ncards are still expensive, despite\\nnot being anywhere near as meta relevant. The newest wave of expensive\\npromos have been from the promo pack given out at sealed draft events. These events were limited\\nto usually eight players and gave out prize packs that gave you two out of eight\\nexclusive promos. Needless to say, barely anyone got these\\nand the cards in them went to the moon. Blue Luffy leader is around $100\\nremoval Luffy which is a very important card in a ton of rogue\\nblue decks is around $80. The other cards from this pack are around\\n30 to $60 as well. Blue should have been a budget color\\nthis format, but with these packs it joins the ranks of the most expensive\\nmeta decks. Your only other option to get them\\nwas to order live action\\nvariant arts directly from Bandai Premium. Now, Bandai is so insistent\\non the promo system because it works very well,\\nor at least better in Japan, where there are more events,\\nmore casual players and more product. It's a disaster in the West and I wish Bandai would understand\\nand only do alternative art as promos. As demonstrated\\nby my almost max rarity Kin’emon deck. I do not mind expensive promos. Just make sure they're all alt arts\\nand not unique cards in the future. We have two new problematic\\npromos releasing soon. Instead of putting the cards in a starter\\ndeck. Bandai is releasing eight exclusive cards\\nfor the Starter Deck uta strategy as promos for a series\\nof special starter deck only events. If these events are handled\\nlike the sealed battle events, the only budget deck in the game\\nwill be out of the reach of most players. I have heard that you are going to get each promo for entering the event,\\nbut it's really player cap That's the issue. We're also likely to get a new event promo\\nin Yellow Zoro. It's got a very strong trigger effect\\nand will likely be a four of in most yellow decks. It's going to be even more necessary\\nand more meta than promo Jinbe and Bortolomeo released before. Since those were $100,\\nas a yellow player I live in fear\\nfor what Bandai will do to my wallet. To summarize, Bandai\\nas your friend and long term fan. Please stop printing mechanically\\nunique cards as promos. It would be better for the community as\\na whole if you just made them all alt arts. Events Are Still Hard To Get Into Events still have the problem of being too hard\\nto get into. The most recent wave of webcam events\\nfilled up 500 spots in about 4 minutes. If you have a job or a family\\nand can't make time to start the signup list, you're not welcome in the one piece\\ncard game, according to Bandai. And this is a massive shame\\nbecause events are very fun to go to. I've only been able\\nto get into one regional so far and it was an absolute blast. The community was amazing. The games for fun\\nand the prizing was great. It's just a shame that no one can get in. I know there are a ton of players\\nwho would otherwise be interested,\\nbut don't even try to get into them because they know it's\\nso rough to get into. For comparison, Yugioh has 4 to 5 regionals\\nper year in Houston, Texas alone, and one piece has 3\\nto 4 regionals in Texas each year. Also, usually with a lower player cap.\\nThe worst of the worst for Bandai events has been with the sealed product events\\nand the first anniversary tournament. The sealed events forced local game stores\\nto limit it to only eight players. Most local tournaments\\nusually run at least 16 players or higher. Imagine getting kicked out\\nof your local tournament one week because Bandai told you to go\\nfuck yourself. The first anniversary event\\nalso left stores in limbo. It replaced the set five prerelease event\\nand also had a reduced player cap of 16 instead of the usual 32. Most players I know either didn't play for those weeks\\nthe event was running or mass signed up for as many events as possible\\nto collect the promos to resell them. I can't even blame them. It was a $10 entry that gave a $40 or $20. Don!!, some miscellaneous first anniversary\\nstamped cards, and a shot at first place,\\nwhich gave you a $300 prize card. The event was great, but Bandai\\njust needed to expand the player cap to let both the local community and the outside players\\ntraveling around to participate. It doesn't make sense to me. That when one piece as a game\\nwould be growing, Bandai would be shrinking events. Something's fishy. This is either actively malicious\\nfrom Bandai or the biggest case of corporate stupidity\\nthat I've seen since every other card game company. Oh my God. I need a new hobby. The Future and Conclusions The two big sets in the future\\nare both extremely promising. Extra booster one, as I mentioned\\nbefore, is my favorite product they've ever released. Set six on the other seems to be a repeat\\nof what set three was the set two. By this I mean the already massive\\nstrength of the color black will be getting an absurd powerboost\\ninto the game. It's Whitebeard all over again, but\\nwe'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Overall, I do have a lot of complaints\\nand I do give this game quite a bit of grief, but that doesn't change how bright\\nthis game's future can be. Plus, I absolutely love the mechanics\\nand the community. It just needs Bandai not to drop the ball\\nlike they did with the Naruto card game, The Dragon Ball\\nSuper card game, the Digimon card game, the original Dragon Ball card\\ngame or Battle spirits saga twice, wow the energy\\njust got real dark there for a second. But back to the point. One piece is a great game,\\nbut I do recommend you play. Maybe not for its current price tag\\nif it's outside your budget, but it's worth your time to try out. There's a free online simulator\\nthat i’ve linked the Discord two in the description\\nI can't do it to directly. Thanks, Bandai, but I love the game\\nand I've only stuck around because of how much better\\nits been than other games. Bandai, despite its flaws,\\nis giving the consumers a good product. The problem of needing more events\\nand products aren't the worst problems to have. Plus, they can be fixed\\nand aren't fundamental to the game itself. I look forward to\\nwhere the one piece card game will go and I'll most likely be sticking\\naround for a while yet. All right. And that's all. If you like this video, please subscribe. I really enjoy talking about my thoughts\\non the state of card games, so there's a ton of cool stuff\\nin the works. Plus, ti've got great deck profiles\\nalong the way as well.

Transcript:\\nHow to Play One Piece Card Game from a Magic Player! hey everyone I'm Patrick Marlet your local game guy here to teach you how to play One Piece card game from the perspective of a magic player one piece Deck Construction & Victory Condition card game is intended for 1 V one though there are multiplayer modes with each deck consisting of one leader 50 cards and 10 Dawn your Mana source for this game Your Leader is a lot like a commander it's accessible from the start of the game but unlike Commander it always starts in play and is the victory condition for the game knock out the opposing leader you'll do so by reducing the leader life total to zero and hitting them for one final blow or less dramatically a player can lose should they deck themselves or run out of cards each leader features a singular power value at the top right typically 5,000 next to an attribute type A Life total indicated at the bottom right a subtyping just under the leader's name and lastly an ability that usually influences both how the deck will be constructed and played so again not too dissimilar to Commander oh and most importantly the leader you choose to play dictates the colors in which you can play that's that's right we have color identity this can be found at the bottom left of each leader card within the hexagonal pattern each side representing a different color and some leaders actually feature more than one color meaning you can construct in Card Types & General Rules multiple there are four card types in one piece card game leader character event and Stage similarly to leader cards characters have an attack value also next to an attribute type A subtyping under their name and an effect box often with but sometimes without an effect to not not able differences are the cost featured at the top left in the counter symbol and value scene on some characters featured left of their portrait these essentially act as instant speed combat tricks but more on that later it's important to note you can cast as many characters as you like but you can only have up to five and play at any time if you cast a sixth you must first remove one from Battlefield or character area to the graveyard called trash here before proceeding like characters events feature a cost name and subtyping in all the same same spots you'd expect but are onetime effects that can only be played at certain times as indicated on the card again there's that counter symbol on guardo but you'll also notice main on gumgum jet pistol both these cards also feature a trigger effect when you take life in this game There's an opportunity to play these effects but we'll touch on that later once we cover turn order I promise it all Mak sense our last card type is stage like our leader that exist in the leader area there is a stage area to play stages into you may only have one in play at a time and just like characters if you were to play out another stage you'll first remove the previous from your stage area stages feature a cost name subtype and of course effect typically these will read activate main which like a sorcery means you can only do it on your turn Beyond resting or tapping the card for its effect you may see an additional activation cost before the colon a number in white means you need to rest or tap the specified number of dawn in addition to tapping it or it could ask you to trash or discard a card as part of of its activation cost and with card features types and Basics to deck construction covered let's talk setup Setup & Starting Play setup involves shuffling your deck and placing it aside placing your Dawn deck adjacent the cost area putting your leader face up in the leader area generally Center table and deciding player order with either rock paper scissors as recommended by the official one piece card game manual or rolling dice high or low take your pick once turn order is determined draw five cards each player May then decide whether to keep or reshuffle the five cards drawn back into their decks and draw five more the player going first elects to do so before the second player if you do reshuffle the five cards you draw next you must keep and both players then proceed to draw the designated number of Life cards as set by their leader and place them into their life area after which the player going first starts the game all right we know the victory conditions we've seen the cards we know the setup for a two-person game now let's play One Piece card game has five 5 Phases of a Turn main phases the refresh phase like the untap step is where players untap all their rested Dawn cards and set them as active in the cost area right where you keep your lands during this phase you'll also set any leader character or stage cards as active the draw phase where you'll draw one card before proceeding however the player going first will not draw on their starting turn the dawn phase where you'll place two Dawn cards from your Dawn deck into your cost area set as active provided you only have one Dawn card left you'll place that amongst your Mana sources instead and provided you're on the play the player going first only places one Dawn card into their cost area to begin with the main phase is where all the good stuff happens you can play cards to include characters stages and activate Main Events activate any card effects to include characters just played or your leader give Dawn cards which as the card suggest increases a leader or character's Power by 1,000 and lastly battle all of which can be handled in any order lastly we have the nonto thrilling end phase where any end of your turn and similar effects take place then play passes to your opponent but let's backtrack a bit what is battle you ask well it's what makes one piece card game so thrilling to play and not too unlike Magic the Gathering it's layered but not quite as much battle flow takes Steps of Battle place in five steps attack declaration block step counter step damage step and end of battle step during the declare attacker step you may attack with any active leader or character that has been in play since the last turn to include your opponents otherwise they're summoning sick some characters feature the rush effect that works exactly like the keyword haste allowing them to attack on the turn in which they are played you may always attack the opposing leader and can also attack any rested or tapped opposing characters during this step any when attacking effects or effects that trigger from a leader or character attacking will trigger and resolve here the blocker step allows the player being attacked the opportunity to activate any characters with the blocker effect doing so causes said character to rest and as you imagine redirects the oncoming attack to them you may use the blocker effect even if the character with set effect was just played the counter step is where interaction comes into play remember the counter symbol as seen on some characters and events you may trash or discard any characters from your hand to increase the power of the leader character or blocker being attacked by the value dictated on the trash card in this instance 2000 by suru you may also pay the requisite Dawn to trash or discard any events with the counter effect from your hand during the step for their ability you may activate any counter effects in any order as many times as you'd like during the damage step compare the power of the attacking and defending C cards the attacking card wins The Exchange provided the power meets or exceeds the defending card's power this will lead to either the opposing leader taking one damage in retrieving a life card from their life area if said leader has zero life cards remaining the attacking player wins the game or the opposing character gets ko'ed however if the attacking card's power is less than the defending card nothing happens better luck next time try again when the opposing leader is damaged they'll go to take a card from their life area and place it into their hand however if the card they pull into their hand has a triggered effect they may elect to reveal said trigger effect instead of adding it to their hand activating the ability of said card Keywords & Conditions though you can choose not to activate a trigger effect just as well note also that your leader may take two or more damage on Attack by effect such as double attack that deals two damage to leaders when successful triggers will resolve as usual and you'll have the potential opportunity to use more than one however if a card with banish successfully attacks Your Leader the card from your life area is trashed or placed in your great graveyard instead regardless of whether it has a trigger or not lastly the end of battle step allows for any effects that activate at end of battle to take place then all effects applied during said battle are negated one piece card game is a fun and excellent strategy game you can learn to play in a single sitting but will take several to master it's easily one of the best tcgs to come out in recent date and furthermore if you're a fan of One Piece you'll find a lot here I hope this guide Thanks for Watching! helps you get started as a newer player or someone looking to get into your first pre-release when I began this game I had so many questions that I needed to resolve before I felt confident on my one piece journey and now I can say I am extremely happy playing and collecting this game again

become increasingly popular among one piece fans and TCG players alike many people enter the game every day but not everyone knows exactly how to play it competitively by participating in the many offline and online competitions you will have the chance to get many rare and valuable exclusive cards so even if you're mainly a collector you probably don't want to miss out on the competitive aspect of the one piece card game this is a fun and relatively easy game to play so if you want to learn the basic of the one piece TCG this video is just for you hello Internet and welcome to my channel TCG monkey here in the one piece TCG two players Face Off With Their powerful pirate Crews your goal is to reduce your opponent's Life To Zero by attacking with your crew including your own leader and using event and Stage cards when the opponent's leader is out of life you need to close the game by delivering one finishing attack Card Types in this game there are five main types of cards leader cards each player selects one leader card to represent their crew Your Leader sets your strategy defines your play style and comes with special abilities the leader is crucial in battles and it also starts with a certain number of life points based on the card which you can see on its bottom right corner character cards character cards are your crew members these cards are what you'll use to attack your opponent's leader and other characters or defend your own characters have a cost that you can see on the top left corner and power values that you can see on the top right some of them come with special abilities to give you an edge in battle event cards these are your action cards event cards allow you to pull off special moves or disrupt your opponent's plans with a single play you can use them one time and then you have to discard them in the trash stage cards stage cards represent location or ships that give you ongoing benefits on your crew throughout the game they are played in the stage area of the game board and have lasting effects up until they are removed each player can have up to one stage card in play Dawn cards Dawn cards are the main resource of the game placed in the cost area each turn they are rested in order to pay for the costs of the cards or activate some cards effect they are similar to the man of magic some of the event and character cards have a trigger effect which you can activate only when a card with a trigger is added to your end from the life area after your leader is taking life damage you are not Force to activate it you can choose to do so triggers cannot be activated in any other way now that you know the types of cards in the game let's talk about how to set up your game board each player needs to create a deck Gameboard of 50 cards which includes characters events and Stage cards you'll also Place Your Leader card in front of you the leader is not included in the 50 cards that make up your deck all the cards within the deck must share at least one color with your leader as some leaders have two colors and you can have maximum four copies of the same card after you decide who goes first between you and your opponent the deck is shuffled and you draw five cards to form your starting hand if you are not happy with your first five cards that you draw you can put them back in your deck reshuffle it and draw other five cards you can redraw your opening hand only once each game once you're good with your opening hand you need to place a number of cards corresponding to your Leader's life points to the life area and another key aspect of the game is your Dawn deck as I said before the dawn cards are a special resource used to play your characters and activate abilities each player has a deck of 10 Dawn cards placed in a separate Zone all cards have How to Play Cards a play cost that you can see on the upper left side of the card you can play a card if you have enough active Dawn cards and when you do rest the number of dawn cards by turning them sideways equal to the cost of the cards that you play during that turn you can unlock the effect fake card in two ways for some cards you need to place a required amount of active Dawn cards to unlock the effect for example to activate the effect of this Sanji card you need to attach two Dawn cards to it these Dawn cards can be placed underneath the card during the main phase whenever you attach a dawn card to any character its power increases by 1,000 you can attach as many active Dons as you want to any of your characters in play for other cards you need to return a required amount of dawn cards back to the dawn deck in order to activate their effect these Dawn cards can come from anywhere on the board active or rested for example this kaido card asks you to return seven Dawn cards to the dawn deck in order to activate its powerful effect okay now that we are set up let's jump into how to actually play the one piece card game the game is played in turns Game Phases and each turn has five phases refresh phase draw phase Dawn phase main phase and then phase in one piece you rest a character after you attacked or blocked an attack with that card by turning it sideways after resting it the card will remain in that state until the refresh phase of your next turn during the refresh phase all the cards will be turned upright and become active again all da cards assigned will return as active in the cost area each turn after the first you will draw one card from the top of your deck at the moment there is no limit on the number of cards you can have on your hand but if your deck runs out of cards before your opponents you lose the game once the draw phase has concluded you move on to the dawn phase this is where you increase the number of dawn cards in your cost area each player gains two da cards per turn with the player going first only getting one Dawn card on their first turn next you have the main phase this Main Phase is where most of the action happens you can use your Dawn cards to summon characters play events or use abilities you can also attack your opponent's leader or their characters characters cannot attack the turn they're played unless they have an effect stating otherwise and each player can have a maximum of five characters in play if you want to add a new character on the board and you already have five characters you need to play one of your characters in play to the trash once you place your characters you can assign them Dawn cards to activate their effects or increase their power by 1,000 per Dawn attached when you attack you choose one of your characters to Target your opponent's leader or their character compare their power levels if your attacking character's power is equal or greater than the targets you win the battle you can attack your opponents leader either if it's rested or active but you can only attack your opponent's character if they're rested you can attack as many times as you want depending on the number of characters that you have in play with each attack happening one at a time when you declare an attack your opponent can block or counter a block occurs when the opponent redirects an attack aim to their leader or another character to a blocker that they have in play meaning a character that has the blocker ability in order to block an attack the blocker must be active and it can only block one attack it cannot block multiple attacks after blocking an attack if it has not been defeated the blocker is then rested a counter occurs when your opponent chooses to increase the power of their leader or their character's attack by using cards from their hand some cards have counter effects that you can see on the left side of the card or as an actual effect that can be activated during in this phase of the battle if you choose to use a counter you just place the card with the counter effect in the trash right after using that effect you can counter as many times as you want for example if your leader has 5,000 power you can use a counter that gives your leader plus 1,000 power and another one that gives plus 2,000 power so your leader then has 8,000 power when battling the counter can be activated only when attacked by the opponent not during one's own turn to power up your characters before attacking just assign them Dawn cards to increase their power by 1,000 per Dawn assigned after this the damage is then calculated if the attacker's power is less than the Defenders nothing happens if the attacker's power is equal or greater to the defender's power the attacker wins when the attacker wins the battle if the defender was a normal character such character is then put in the trash while if the defender was the opponent's leader the opponent suffers life damage and draws a card from the life area trigger effects can only be activated here after attacking the character is then rested by turning the card sideways once you have finished attacking and there is nothing else you need to do you reach the end phase where you end your turn and your opponent can start theirs any end of turn effect will happen at this point the game then continues back and forth until one Player's leader has no life points left and the other player delivers the finishing blow to be then declared the winner now that you know Tips how to play Let's talk about a few very basic tips to help you get better at the game cards can have six different colors each color provides different ways to play the game each with its strengths and weaknesses for example red usually provides for aggressive strategies that put early pressure on the opponent while green provides more control strategies try different colors and choose the one that better adapts to your play style each turn you need to choose whether to use your Dons to either play a character on the field in increase the power of your active characters or activate effects always think forward to what can be the best play that will help you win the game make sure your deck has a mix of characters events and stages so you can adapt to different situation on the battlefield sometimes your initial strategy may not go well as you were expecting so having cards that can help you pivot your strategy is very important sometimes it's better to save some cards for later on and give up a life point in the early stages of a game which also gives you an additional card that could turn your game around on some occasions protecting your characters might be more important than protecting your leader many cards have unique abilities that can turn the tide of a match always look for combos between your cards to maximize your strategy that was it for today's video let me know in the comments down below if you think this was helpful and see you soon with a new video this is G monkey out\",\n",

way to start your Dawn collection is by picking up the altar dawn cards that come with each main set as many of you already know every main set in the One Piece card game includes a specific alternate art dawn card essentially a foil version of a memorable manga scene that fits the set's theme for example OP01 features Luffy setting out on his adventure taken straight from the manga's first chapter Romans Dawn which is also the set's name op02 showcases Shanks stopping the Marine Fort War perfectly aligning with the set's focus on the Tark this pattern continues with each main set except for EB01 the first ever mini set which has no old Tart Dawn card and PRB01 a reprint set that doesn't include them but instead introduces 30 character Dawn cards which I'll cover later you're basically guaranteed an altered dawn card in any booster box of a main set making them widely available and keeping their prices low usually under $1 if adding Manga Don!! just one dawn card per main set release isn't enough for you there are more foiled manga snapshot dawn cards available in other opts like double packs and devil fruit collections double packs introduced with OP04 contain two booster packs from the latest expansion and one of two foiled alter dawn cards both following the set's theme this collection doesn't stop here other dawn cards in this category have been released exclusively as promos or event rewards examples include the Yamato and Luffy dawn card for the OPTCG first anniversary and the Garp dawn card for the second anniversary before continuing with this video if you enjoy this type of content I kindly ask you to like the video and subscribe to the channel this will help me grow and bring you better content thank you Alternate Font Don!! another fascinating aspect of Donard collecting is the variety of fonts and foil designs which add an extra layer of exclusivity these design differences make a big impact and can help you create a stunning collection you can start by collecting the various basic Dawn cards from the super pre-release Dawn and the foil Dawn found in the Ultimate decks to the 3D font the red and black Dawn the blue Chinese exclusive and the gold version then Championship & Tournament Don!! there are tournament and championship dawn cards some of the rarest in the game these are typically given out as prices at a level competitions meaning that owning one signifies either top tier competitive success or a lucky acquisition through trading or purchasing on the secondary market these cards usually feature a stamp with the tournament logo and can be either exclusive designs or reprints of other Dawn cards altered character Dawn cards Alt Art Character Don!! add another layer of personality to the collection these cards feature iconic One Piece characters directly on the Dawn cards creating some of the most visually striking designs prb01 introduced these cards in three different rarities normal foiled and gold with the latter being the rarest and most expensive more recently new Dawn cards with similar character designs have appeared in double packs such as the RA and Whitebeard Dawn cards in DP05 the cost of collecting these character dawn cards varies greatly with normal versions going for a few dollars while the rarest gold versions can sell for thousands many golden dawn cards from PRB01 are priced at more than $100 while the Flamingo Loa and Yamato are valued at around $200 with Zoro surpassing $300 given their popularity I expect this category to expand further and a PRB02 set is almost certainly on Bandai's radar Special Event & Promo Don!! beyond these there are special and alternate art dawn cards from unique promo collections exclusive events and limited time releases these cards are often produced in very small numbers making them some of the most desirable Dawn cards on the market a great example is the SHA crew inspired Dawn collection where each card features an illustration representing an iconic characteristic of a crew member other highly sought after Dawn cards includes those exclusively distributed at One Piece Day events some of which fetch incredibly high prices Other Alt Art Don!! there are also unique releases that don't quite fit into any of the categories I've covered like the recently announced special dawn sets featuring an alternate art dawn card with Luffy Sabo and Ace or the latest Devil Fruit collection which includes two alter Dawn cards of Sabo and Ace for Most Valuable Don!! those wondering about the most expensive Dawn cards the 2023 Championship Finals Luffy Dawn currently holds the record selling for over $2,000 it will soon be joined by the 2024 Championship Finals Luffy Don which has yet to hit the market as mentioned earlier Golden Dawn cards from PRB01 command high prices while the oldart Utadon given out exclusively at the 2024 One Piece Day has sold for more than $200 in some cases looking ahead it's clear that the One Piece card game will continue releasing amazing new Dawn cards making the collection even more exciting as more sets come out older Dawn cards will become harder to find increasing the rarity and potential value if you're a fan of the One Piece card game now is the perfect time to start your Dawn card collection whether you're drawn to the stunning artwork the affordability or the thrill of hunting down rare pieces Dawn cards offer a fun and rewarding way to engage with the OPTCG that's it for today's video don't forget to let me know your thoughts in the comments down below and I'll see you next time tcg Monkey out\",\n",
