to go over some of my favorite battles from the different finals and tournaments of One Piece 09 in preparation for the World Finals in March okay the first battle we're going to look at is probably my favorite battle out of all of Japan for all of the tournaments I mean I was there casting all of them but this one was something special it is the finals of II which is probably one of the biggest tournaments we had in Japan over a thousand people around 1,300 and it's Shanks versus doflamingo right now it's doflamingo's turn and Shanks has just ended his turn turn two with three da active so let's watch what damingo does so he set up his buggy uh there is a g bay on top of his deck and now he's going to attack with his leader ability and we see jebe uh so next coming up we asks his opponent and this is very key are you going to use your shank's ability so this is actually one of those funny weird interactions that you don't see a lot in the one piece trading card game when J comes out on the attack before jinbe's effect goes off your opponent has to decide whether or not he's going to reduce something uh now normally the play is you reduce the jinbe and then you use red hawk to KO the jinbe as well as protecting uh the attack but because of the ordering of the sequencing and knowing how the decks work he's able to have him even though he reduced the jimbe here he's going to be able to use Hancock's effect to pump up the jimbe and because he played the jimbe first he's able to decide if you're going to reduce my gimbe I'm going to play Hancock and then attach to the dawn to protect the jimbe and if you're not he also had a weevil that was a different option that he had in his hand uh it was an amazing play that completely changed the tempo of the game wasted three Dawn from his opponent which completely invalidated his second turn and now you can see he's just stunned even icho the player is completely stunned just like oh that's a thing you can do it was a great moment and uh tappy is also going to be in the finals this year in Japan so he's definitely a player to look out for this March so for our next battle we're going across the ocean to America where we have purple Luffy versus black yellow Luffy in the first round of the American finals for Wave 2 uh so it's purple Luffy he's on nine Dawn right now and he wants to try to you know mess up the black yellowy plan I mean it's very very common situation they're at two life you don't want to make it easy for them to go into that zero life 9,000 power situation but you also don't want to just do nothing so what he's going to do here is he's going to attack wanji and then he's going to use his nine cost mom to put the GARP on top of his opponent's life making it very hard for him to have a very successful turn getting to that 9,000 life but we see Jackson play around it perfectly so Jackson's in a pretty rough situation here he has GARP on top of his life and that's kind of a little bit hard to deal with you're going to either have to play Hui and waste it you're going to have to play a machino and waste it uh or you're going to have to but so what he does here he plays Yori he takes his bottom life and then plays his the five cost Luffy from the starter deck on top of his life and then uses the two cost Luffy the baby Luffy to get the L the five cost Luffy onto his field now he uses that Luffy to get rid of the card that was put in there by the nine cost mom and also draw a card so now even though he was probably looking at going the next turn he has to burn two cards he's probably looking at having 9,000 power with one card because of the way he's able to navigate this with his Hui he's able to get an extra card out of it and even an extra life out of it while having a perfect setup to finish the game and he will go on to win this game and take out purple Luffy for our last match We're Going Back Down Under to Australia where we have the finals for Oceania uh it is the third place match between black yellow Luffy and Hancock and it was a very interesting match so they're 1-1 right now and we're in the final round where we have our black yellow player so going into this last match we see black yellow with a very very interesting Tech card that he's going to use as well as the normal you know black yellow movements to get rid of the blockers and also play around the tin cot kaido that he saw from his opponent in a previous [Music] game so now he's going to use his leader effect to put in two of the Egghead Luffy into his life and then he's going to follow that up with playing two baby luffies to get rid of the two blocker laws and of course this is a strong play he's going to be able to attack his opponent's life but one of the things that I really found interesting about not only this game but this Kevin's build in general is the use of two very interesting cards uh I have my crew and Tempest kick the entire build is focusing on drawing cards rather than actually searching for cards so he's more likely to look at and find his eight cos moras and it also finds a very interesting place here where he's able to pump his 8 C Moria playing around 10 cost kaido that he saw in previous matches ensuring that he's going to be able to have his big hitter for the next turn so he's going to be able to actually finish up the game and not just be stuck with one Sao that might be lost in the following turn because of his opponent's big attackers well that does it for me there were some awesome Battles Through This Championship season but the World Finals is about about to be underway and the World Finals of course will have the best battles of them all last year sanji's peel off was definitely making a name for itself and I can't wait to find out what the card of the tournament is going to be this March I hope you tune in and watch it and I can't wait to see you guys there [Music]\",\n",

time to duel so here we go it's game number one of the finals of the 2024 Yu-Gi-Oh World Championship Reuben gets to go first here with his ubel deck we've seen him take the lead in several games at this point and the UB deck is so strong at going first it's almost Unstoppable Reuben carrying the hopes of Jose along with him is going to start this duel off match up draw or standby fith sakei versus fi Smith ubell Ruben starts off with Samar D Lotus enough to get the entire combo started on its own but not nearly as powerful as opening something along the lines of opening of the spirit Gates so just only an individual combo but we're not stopping anything this far y since Rd Lotus is going to attribute itself to special summon Spar to ubel from the deck on summon Spar to ubel is going to let Reuben add or set a card that mentions ubel and yep night pain is the go-to here nightmare Pain's being activated is there a a response there is no response from Mark and we will destroy the spirit of ubel going to resolve nightmare pain adding the gruesome grave scrimer Spirit ell's effects going to activate when it's destroyed to special summon a ubell from the deck to the field looking at off a lot like his semifinal match so far with no interaction from Mark let's see what Ruben's next move is going to be it looks like he is going to reveal that gruesome grave scor to try and special summon it opting to special summon or sorry and destroy the ubel probably trying to find more materials to add to the graveyard so he can access Phantom Yubel from that extra deck so we see ubel the Terra incarnate come down I just double check scorers effect go ahead y gr grave squirmer does have a couple of really good effects being able to special summon and then destroy if you so choose when it's in the graveyard it's also going to be able to banish itself and special summon back a monster later on I think Mark taking note of how many summons have been done at this point so performing a leak summon here Ruben's going to send both his monsters to the graveyard to summon the link to unchain soul lord of Yama that's going to let him add an Unchained monster from his deck to his hand there's only one choice and it is Shara goad and summon Phantom of all right and now he's going to return the two materials required to Fusion summon Phantom of ubell from the extra deck Phantom ell is going to protect him from Monster effects as it can change the monster effect to force uh to become just to destroy ubel from the deck now as I said gruesome grave scor is going to banish itself from the gra speci back Spirit of ubel this is a great start here for Reuben go no responses from Mark up to this point with the Phantom already on the field it's going to be way more difficult to get anything through spirit all right the Shar is going to destroy Spirit of youel while the on summon effect is once turn the effect when it is destroyed to special summon ell from the deck is not or from the graveyard let's seeing is he just put some ell monsters back the deck might as well get him from there there's also no once per turn on summoning The Phantom of ubel so the more monsters you get the more Phantoms you can summon all right taking a moment to consider his next move carefully Ruben's done this combo several times up to this point so just has to go through the motions try to consider what could from Mark side a link summon here going to S both those monsters to the graveyard to summon Unchained soul of Rage since shavar was sent to the graveyard it's going to let him set an Unchained trap card from his deck it's going to go for abominable chamber of the unchanged AIO I cannot thank [Music] looks like Reuben is shuffling his deck thoroughly now indicating that he is done with it for the turn a little bit of a surprise he's pretty well insulated right now has the Yama in the graveyard has Unchained soul of Rage Phantom ubell protecting him he has not access the fith part of his engine yet so I'm surprised he's nope doesn't look like he is going to get any fith cards online but during the in Phase the Sam SAR Lotus is going to come back because ubel will require something to be tributed during the in Phase or it will go to the graveyard opting to still attribute the ubell anyway can I read Lotus yes let taking another look here at Lotus it's a bit of a tricky card okay very rare to see this part of lotus's effect be activated yeah so a start but missing that other half of the deck here for Reuben so it's not going to have something like DDD highwave King Caesar on the field we'll see how Mark's going to Pilot his snake ice strategy through this field now he didn't interact at all during Reuben's turn so you got to figure that his hand is full of ways to act instead that could be the case here Divine Temple of the snake eye the first action here from Mark picking up half the deck not top half you know how much I love that what do you think the over under on number of times that the card they're looking for was in the correct half of the deck 100% of the time it's on the bottom yeah but Snake Eyes diell star is going to be placed in that spell and trap zone to be summoned later on and the next up is bonfire Reuben has no response bonfire is going to let him at a level four or lower pyro monster and it's going to be that Snake Eyes Poplar effect po effect is activated in the hand special summon self is going to be able to activate on the field to add a snake ice spell trap already has the Divine Temple so he's probably going to be looking to access Here We Go Again bottom out original sinful Spoils of the Snake Eyes now we know because the Unchained solar rage is on the field you can go intoa into the zone that it points to could will be a good way to force out the Unchained solar rage potentially but he could also hold off on it since he does have abominable but having the soul rage in the spell and trap card Zone would be also ignore that bonfire Colossus it's actually supposed to be bonfire so soul of Rage yep going to used right away here on Ena important to note polar wasn't activated either that's something key to note holding off on thegg so chain link one Divine Temple to try and summon the snake ey diell star chain link 2 Reuben's SP KN is going to the Snake Eyes diabar from the spell and trap zone that's huge Ruben taking advantage of how turn player priority works here to get the banish off in the way that he wants but there is a normal summon of snake ey oak snake ey Oak will let Him special summon back that Poplar from the graveyard but Phantom Vell might have something to say about it or SP little Knight's going to take that snake eye Oak off the field temporarily Until the End phase but that means it's going to be harder for Mark to access something like Snake Eyes flame burst dragon from the deck without using his original ful spoils but even still if he original sinful spoils it's going to be harder to get a couple monsters on the field since he's already used Snake Eyes poplars effect from the hand so Reuben still got that Phantom hubell on the field and we also saw that he's got quite a large number of cards in hand and we've been holding that Ash Blossom for the original simple spoil that's a huge Ash Blossom and joy spring here from Reuben I guess that makes a lot of sense if he doesn't have the fiend Smith cards he probably has more points of interaction from his hand there to help uh with the field that he was able to create on turn number one looks like it's just going to be a set from Mark wow so Reuben able to stop mark from going any further here in his turn Mark could you please straighten up your graveyard sure thank don't forget to switch your tough start here for Mark yep Mark choos to end the main phase here going into battle phe forced to go to battle phase thanks nightmare P so he's going to take 700 points to damage reflected back at him Reuben gets to have another turn here SP L Knight resolves summoning back the oak as well as the I'm just thinking [Music] on and then still in the end face interesting positioning on little Knight there Act AC Ates the bondol Chamber of the unchain special back oh for the Yama that had not been used yet getting back the Shara things are looking really good here for Ruben in game number one still the targeting wow and he has the beal drworm on top of it if things didn't already look really good they're getting even better Reuben opting to go for a more of a half field just to really conserve his resources for the following turn cuz he needs to just do just enough to stop his opponent and he had confidence with the cards in his hand that he had enough already Ash bossom proving critical there holding it back until the very last moment to make sure that mark C get things going stand by moved into the main phase I'm going to go ahead and Link summon he for nightmare Phoenix First action here from Ruben is a link summon for nightmare Phoenix and that's going to be co- link with SP Knight they'll be able to discard a card to destroy a spell and trap card and then draw a card discards the bigger youell that's great to put in the graveyards because you can use it as a material if something happens to that Phantom of ubel it looks like it was just a bluff bonfire but this Phoenix gets a lot of value the draw the effect banishing the Poplar because of the or not banishing but sending it to the graveyard because of drw form thinking confidently in the driver's seat right now is Reuben doesn't want to make any silly mistakes at this point in the duel look like he's going to make another Phantom of youell here Returns the materials either he wants to protect himself more or it's just giving another monster on the field he uses a material to continue to link climb he does have to watch out for maybe a pair of cards even though Mark only has a pair cards in Hand That Could disrupt him yeah could really only be afraid of effect failer paired with something along the lines in be the problem being if there was an infinite permanence it would have been set to the field already exactly so those Phantom Ells are really putting in a lot of work here but he is going to send one to the graveyard two special summon shavara from the hand I'll go ahead and ENT battle face oh opting to enter the battle pH straight up 900 another 900 since Night P refle the damage back at mark- three - yeah uh I'm going to attack over y it's going to be another 700 points of damage4 not 54 57 not going to be quite enough here cuz it's 19 2000 and another 2000 oh actually yeah it's 59 it's 59 all right and Reuben takes game number one over Mark and now just one game way from becoming the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG ocg world champion but you don't see a smile on his face still sto still F focused knows that the job is not done just yet yeah watching Reuben it feels like he's so locked in and forces me to just lock into the game with them and I want to take a moment to note that Yubel has been known to be this explosive strategy right when it gets to go first it really makes the biggest board that he can and I feel like that's not what Ruben comes here to do today at least not in game one he dedicated most of his to be able to break boards and be able to play going second so he is a little bit lacking in what he wants to do going first but he's able to do just enough and really conserve his resources and play really close to his chest and just really control state of the game and he didn't really commit any of his resources to any of those plays and he was able to play Under most of the possible responses that Mark could have had for example a card that I haven't seen this weekend out of any the ubel Duelist was rudras which is one of those things that you associate with kind of the highroll full combo board they have haven't seen it at all once this weekend and is whether that's just not playing at all or just deciding that going with that more measured approach is better that's how it's turned out and it's worked very well so far yeah I definitely like the mid-range kind of strategy here from Ruben but at the same time Mark hasn't lost around yet he has did have one draw but I'm sure he may have dropped a couple of game ones throughout the tournament but now he's diving into his side deck this is where things can change up he knows he's going to go first so that's already you know going to feel a little more comfortable but uh ubel has is one of those decks might be able to Target down from your side deck going into the world championship these were the top two Decks that players were looking at to be the top contenders after seeing that combined forbidden limited list from the ocg and TCG and so they're definitely prepared for these matchups here in the finals um a second what he's saying if I try and focus on it you can definitely hear them okay yeah back certainly not Mark's first match up against ubel probably not even the first one that he didn't get to go first in yeah you know there is going to be that big disparity at least in game one but post side you have a lot more options available to you especially when you know you're going second in match up like that he just has to be able to win going first in the game that he can control yeah I'm also going to just request that the maybe our commentary audio be turned off in the studio cuz I think the value of the players having Integrity is more important than uh than the audience being able to hear our conversation here right now so I'll take a moment and see if anyone could listen to that request but we are excited to be here in the finals but we are also trying to be quiet because the players are picking us up [Music] sorry sleeves are getting [Music] caught the tension is palpable in this room right now you could cut it with a knife I'll go first Mark will be going first here in this second game look players are mostly ready here just waiting for the go ahead what lose this will be Mark's only chance to go first in this duel so he's going to need to make it count all right it's time to do it the Duelist have side deck they've shuffled up and it's going to be game number two here at the Yu-Gi-Oh World Championship 2024 in Seattle Washington Grand finals stand by yep so we have our check for perua here it's not there oh we get to finally see the fith engine here marxel is going to be able to lead with the fith engraver I guarantee you the track is not in that top half of the I knew that was coming just picked the whole thing up at once it was actually the bottom card so imagine how quick that would have bit but neither here nor there fi Smith track is in the hand here for Marx engraver we finally see in here the finals fi Smith track's going to let him add a light fiend from the deck to the hand then he's going to have to discard a card it's usually going to be Fable Lor but since he's adding engraver that might already has fabl lry in the hand since fabl L was discarded to the graveyard it's going to special summon itself back to the field now already having used engraver from the hand you might think that's pretty useless in the hand but actually it's an additional light fiend that you can use for Track's grave effect that's right the track grave effect only fuses from hand to field while the sequence one fuses from the graveyard requim going to Tribute itself summon another copy of engraver from the deck I'll use the equips itself now and there is the wanted the one cop of wanted seeker of the sful spoils coming down will there be a de ball star in the top half of the deck there will not it's a fun little mini game though you remember uh pegasus's prophecy card where you had to guess that the monster about to be summoned is above or below 2,000 it's very similar kind of reminds me of that is it in the top or the bottom half of the deck all right want I'm sorry dellar is going to send the reum to special summon itself using its effect going to go ahead and set zero lessons learned it's only been three times this game oh and four in this match sets the original sinful spoils going to link away both his monsters to fith sequence sequence going to be shuffling back the FI with requium as well as looks like one of the engravers more likely the lri yep going to commit to the lurry here to Fusion summon fiend Smith LCA lca's Target engraver's going to hit the field off a lock his effect all right and now Reuben picking up his cards and he's gotten airu the Primal being and it's going to hit the Earth Yep with all those monsters on the field there was a chance he could go directly into appala B the goddess Reuben knowing that is an option drops into Buu the Primal being here Mark not necessarily happy with this but at least he hasn't used his original sinful spell yet he still has the effect of lck to uh hit for 1,200 puts back one of those engravers Mark no longer has to worry about the neiru another it's already resolved he can use the effective engraver in his graveyard oh but there is a Dru worm as well this could be huge we seal jorm's going to banish the engraver that's trying to come back from the graveyard despite their limited status the bis deals here have been huge all throughout the weekend both in the TCG and in master duel when there's only one of them you can really feel their impact sure can especially when it's magn but and suddenly there's two of them the impact of niru the impact of the Beast heals huge here in the finals a tribute summon for the engraver that he added off the FI Smith track he needs a face up card so he's going to be able to use the effective sequence now and then send it with the original sinful spoils will there be a response from Reuben doesn't seem like it okay the chances are pretty high he finds one in the top half this time but no I regret to inform you he's heading to the bottom half of the deck for the one of snake eye Ash snake eye Ash effect is going to let him add that Snake Eyes Poplar to the hand special summon itself to the field polar going to be able to add likely the Divine Temple of the snake eye he picked up the whole deck this time I want to point that out now that it was right on top perfect Divine Temple the Snake Eyes is now in the hand for Marx Alise he's still going to want to clear this board he doesn't want Reuben to start his turn with two monsters on the field to use the Bell stars now in the spell and trap zone unfortunately both effects of sequence and requim have been used so engraver will not likely have anything to to it to use its effect so now we're going to be using Ash with the dellar in order to seems like he's eyeing Snake Eyes Oak Target Ash Oak hits the field targeting the ash to special it back from the graveyard so now Mark's only tools to really remove uh Ruben's field efficiently it will likely be the as field of Knight and because of that he's going to be likely prioritizing The Dru worm he also has a flame Birds Dragon he could just potentially push back that Dru Worm but then he would be able to set up anything for himself yeah going be it's a tough call still has two cards in his hand he' have two cards going to Reuben drawing up to four yeah it feels like he's got to have something on this end Bo but we'll see what it is yeah I mean we know talk about how strong these cards in hand can be all it takes is one card to do the full combo so you need multiple points of interaction here to make sure that Ruben's plays are s enough sty me good word I took the SAT I will flamberg Target Yep looks like the flamberg is going to push the dror back into the spell and trap zone just straight back in there I like these cards where the cards move back and forth between the rows yes the yeah the moon veilance the snake eye cards the motion feels really nice does like when you're playing it it just feels good to push your cards forward so that they can attack all right now we're going to see a link summon here for hea there are no fire monsters in Ruben's graveyard but just trying to get that flame Burge into the graveyard so he can bring back a couple of level ones it's going to be snake ey Oak and snake ey polar still having to deal with the N at this point but you are you do have the freedom to use SP little Knight but using it now means you don't have it for IP P mascara later to get the additional value from the banish on your opponent's turn you still have it onfield effect of course but just really minimizing the amount of full responses that you could have yep definitely the next move is going to be a link some here for promethium princess bestower of flames it's going to bestow Flames to reignite snake ice flamers dragon from the graveyard and now what currently locked Under Fire monsters no Desiree there to negate Promethean princess as we seen many times oh we did see this before from Mark he still plays the Raging Phoenix I love salaman great raging Phoenix it's a good link for fire you can go into it's also great at finishing games let's see if he's going to link it away for world sea dragons Atlantis here or if he's just going to continue his progression of plays that would be another way to actually remove this Nibiru without having to waste the I uh sorry the SP L Knight it does look like that is what Mark is considering yep he's going to use World C dragons L it's going to banish all monsters on the field then special summon them back markets that choose if they go face up face down all their positions but since that Nibiru is special summoned Reuben special summoned a monster which will activate the effect of promethian Princess to destroy the snake ice flamers dragon and the Nibiru the Primal J being now he can use the Raging Phoenix just to put another monster on the field looks like he is going to do just that since a fire monster was destroyed the Salman get Salan great raging Phoenix special summons back from the graveyard and gains the attack of the monster destroyed but chances are it'll be used as a link material here and that is the case cuz he wants to get that princess back into the graveyard Mark really burning through the fire monsters in his extract but he had a ple thr of them now he's going to use Snake Eyes diell star to place flame bird dragon from the graveyard in the spell and trap zone and special summon itself out to the main monster Zone and he still has the two non-link monsters needed to summon IP mascarena I don't know if I've ever seen this board State before but you know having to play through neiru and dorm you have to be able to adapt on the Fly and find a still a strong board at that cuz the the way to deal with IP is to go to battle phase but he has the world sea dragons lantis co-link with the nightmare Phoenix so if he tries to go to battle he can destroy monsters at the any point in the battle phase exactly and he still has the flame bridge in the spell and trap zone so he didn't even lose access to it because of the Temple so anytime Reuben would summon a monster he can push up that flame brige and then still has access to a powerful little Knight while also getting back all the advantage from your graveyard beautiful play here for markise it's a really smart field smart line of play and it's not something you usually see cuz you associate these cards with finishing the duel on turn three or Beyond indeed let's see what he got off of that draw from wanted Seeker the sinful spoils just going to be a pass back here all right Reuben draws four cards in hand versus zantis nightmare Phoenix I mascarena the Divine Temple of the snake eye and a spell card version of Snake Eyes flamber dragon and he starts off with fiend Smith and Graver oh but there is an ash bossom to meet it that was going to be one of the more powerful effects cuz it was going to demand answers immediately as soon as it hits the field alongside of reum as he got the throne he does Nar throne for Reuben he baited out the Ash and now he's free to either destroy or add from his deck probably going to destroy spey ubel if I had to guess but I've been wrong before but nope this time I'm right it is Spirit of ubel being destroyed so he's going to try and special summoning ubel from the deck the faster that he could put up the Phantom ell the faster that he could answer the IP mascarena yeah all right s the monster was summoned Divine to the Snake Eyes is going to allow Marx to push forward that Snake Eyes flame burst Dragon into the main monster Zone all right so now going into the Phantom of Yubel okay which will likely Force the princess in the graveyard doesn't seem to it normal summon samsar D Lotus you tribute that off the field of special summon a youell monster from the deck trying to find that other copy Spirit youell found it y now he's going to use the effect to set nightmare pain from the deck okay night pain is activated going to be able to use its effect here looks like Mark has no responses he needs to force out the Phantom of Yubel at some point if he wants to get the value out of his IP masarina spear in the graveyard can you flip the green card to Red please sorry thank you this is a very tense duel so much on the line what isame I have to like remind myself to breathe every few seconds while I'm watching this yeah so it feels like we're so invested we're just kind of watching we forget to talk about it a little bit Mark is taking a moment to figure out if this is where he wants to try and use his flame Burge Dragon effect or the IP mascarena I wish I could hear their internal monologues right now his IP that is going to start yeah just like the anime kind of exactly that's like a key part of the anime is those internal monologues but Phantom ubel is going to chain link two to IP mascarena to change the effect to destroy ubel from the deck looks like he's thinking about a strong spear to you Bell again yep that's going to be Spirit of ubel destroyed let's see if he has another Monster to summon off of it here doesn't look like it so he'll reveal gruesome Graves SC to sh summon that from the hand and destroys youell and now he's going to use ell's effect special summoning the ter incarnate now I haven't seen an Ultimate Nightmare the entire weekend but this could be a if you can take this ter incarnate off the field and have it summon nothing in return that could be huge well I think that's why he's been holding that mer thron's effect right right that's right he hasn't used it yet okay he been saving it for this princess that he knows it's lurking in Mark's graveyard yeah he's trying his best but there's still plenty of interaction here from Mark's side of things zantis is really Troublesome just sitting there on the field yeah you can't go straight into the battle phase now not that the IP Mas is much more of a threat yep he might be considering princess here Yama on summoned will activate the effect to added an Unchained monster it's going to be that shavara far ends up in Reuben's hand here just a soul lord of Yama so far he has the ability to use the gruesome warmer but before that another Phantom ubel yeah oh man you would think that he wanted to maybe get that princess effect out before another Phantom touchdown the fact the Phantom is once per turn right to negate or to switch the effect no I don't think is it it might be yeah it might actually you can summon multiple turn the effect is only wants to return that's right because you have to use infinite permanence when they have two so he'll be okay he's just going to use it as a material or it doesn't Target yeah you're good y banishes gruesome grave squirmer to special summon back spere to you Bell Shara is going to go after that Spirit to youell I'll go  nightmare Thrones effect has not been used now it will be so he's going to be able to set the Trap from the deck and special summon a ubell of a different level from Spar to ubell one up or one down and it is going to be the terror incarnate yet again the ter incarnate from The Nightmare throne and then from the spirit ubel back the ubel that was shuffled into the deck earlier yep from the graveyard luckily SP you welcome something from anywhere Reuben finding a way here going to make anguish anguish will let him use one of Mark's monsters as material yeah this is what I was talking about earlier Reuben's deck plays a lot of these cards they're not typically in the extra deck choosing to have more utility going second than utility going first you have to do something about this now never here I don't think Mark was prepared for this he would never expect anguish in the UB strategy yeah I'll use uh princess targets targets [Music] that's going to resolve flber is going to be able to add back or summon back multiple level ones from the graveyard but anguish is also going to be able to add back one of those fiends and the princess being co with his Atlantis means now there are three monsters that are Co link so that'll be more cards that can destroy during the battle phase potentially Ruben's going to use yam's effect to banish itself from the graveyard since the card was destroyed and summon back a fiend anguish put back one of those Phantom Ells o and Poplar come from the graveyard to the field thanks to snake I flame bir Dragon anguish comes back thanks to Yama expertly played here from Reuben he's played into many snake eye Fields up to this point he knows what he's looking for Oak's going to add snake ey ash from the hand and wouldn't you know it the original sinful SPS is on the bottom where he put it targeting World zantis Yep this is looking good for Reuben he's going to link away those zantis for axis ker targeting his anguish so it's going to gain 3,000 attack that's a lot of Ells with a lot of nightmare pain going to attack into the promethium princess the damage is reflected the damage is reflected the damage is reflected and that's it Reuben wins your 2024 TCG ocg Yu-Gi-Oh world champion from the United States is Ruben pin [Music] Ronda just incredible you see the camaraderie between the two players from the United States but Reuben for the next year will be the reigning Yu-Gi-Oh TCG ocg world champion ripping it off the Bal not waiting for it to be handed he's taking his trophy the emotion is incredible oh I just can't believe it this has been one of the most storied weekends ever in Yu-Gi-Oh history I it could it's I I'm at a loss for words incredible incredible is the only word I have to describe this I could not think of a more deserving Champion he has been on my radar he has just been doing so well for so long he's had the right mentality he's gone to Regional after Regional from all around North America he's gone down to ycs after ycs winning ycs with his friends but this has to mean the world to [Music] him absolutely amazing just overwhelms it's it's like kind of like a Cascade of emotions that hits you it's not just because you won because you're just so focused always focusing on the next round it's not over till it's over the job isn't done until you finally finish the tournament till you finally won and then when you finally hit that moment and it's just a waterfall of emotions just congratulations to Reuben pinara got to give him a sec to get all these emotions through letting it settle in there he is representing the United States of America and after so many years of the United States not being able to claim that world championship trophy we've now won two years in a row backto back world championships for the United States and couldn't have Happ to a more deserving player just absolutely incredible we've seen him on future match uh before against Jose a couple times you know one of his friends he's always playing his friends and uh to walk away with the title like I said the only word I have to describe this year World Championship is incredible it's a tremendous accomplishment and he really did it the hard way too right he went through all those different events and made it to the points playoffs and you've done the points grind to get those points to make it to the World Championship that way can you talk talk a little bit about that experience and like how difficult it really is oh it is incredibly difficult you can't take any weekends off you have to go to Regional after Regional travel all around America you go to all the yss you want to make sure you're doing your best and not only are you traveling and playing every weekend during the week you're having to prepare you're trying to master each and every format as new cards come out as forbidden limited list change you have to adapt and find a new way to play this isn't the same list that he did well with the points playoffs throughout the year when he's going to the Regionals that's also changed there's been so many different strategies that have come and gone and now there's fi Smith Yubel I mean this isn't even the same deck that he qualified with at the nawcq he had to adapt in the months leading up from there till now and yeah just it's so difficult to play and qualify through the points playoffs and then he even did well at the nawcq after he was already qualified yeah this is about versatility right when you're playing so often you have to be able to adapt you have to be able to switch decks on a flight and I don't think you put into context what it means to play every single weekend it's not you're playing one Regional weekend you're going from one Regional in one city in one weekend the next day you're in a different city in a different Regional know you have jobs you have school you have all that stuff and you still spend all of your weekends on the road it really is incredible dedication let's talk to our champion thank you casters I am live on the player stage with our WCS 2024

of the first eb1 tournament on the one piece Trading Card Game these two players playing for the log post Trophy and the number one serial Shanks trophy card it's going to be a thrilling match between UTA and katak Curry both of those decks making it through the top four and the top eight and also emerging from the 27 other players invited into the national championships my name is atrocious you can also call me Jake I am so excited for this UTA not really having seen too much play here at the national stage for the last couple formats that we've seen has made it in the first E1 format after getting a quick card or two into the deck list has surged to the top I'm so excited for this game but before we get into it I just want full transparency here this is not my stream I am not the one recording and broadcasting this I'm just doing my own unique commentary watching the official live stream I'm not going to monetize this or anything like that because I don't own the content this is just for my own practice on commentary as well as learning a little bit and watching some highle gameplay so I hope you stick around for this kind of unique English commentary and let me know if you enjoy this video we've also got a playlist that you can check out with the iard up top that has the entire tournament every single round I think there's like nine rounds in total that we watch and do videos on and by the time you're watching this every single one of the videos should be out so I'm excited to get into this now with conak curry and UTA I'm not exactly sure how this matchup goes the way that we've seen this UTA deck this player on the left how they've been playing it they have been playing the UTA deck so fast it is an aggressive build it is an aggressive deck and Decks that cannot keep up with it cannot compete with it so I think the advantage is slightly to UTA especially you know if the trigger for kakur has no on plays maybe no blocker sis come into the field right I think could spell a little bit of Doom for the UTA player I don't think the UTA player is playing any uh three drop isos I know with the starter deck releasing in North America just the other week a lot of players have been putting that 2K counter in that deck but this with the EB 1 release I think the new Sanji has actually replaced the iso so very interesting to see we may see it though in this I don't have the exact deck list at this point because I don't want to spoil any results I don't know the actual result of this yet but it looks like the UTA is going to be going first so katakuri doing the Mulligan I would think then that the kak curry probably chose to go second maybe W the rock paper scissors in this probably pretty good not going to probably be able to use the leader effect on the second turn and instead play a three drop character if they have it on their three Dawn turn we haven't seen any of the oppo2 Trafalger laws in this list so I would think that they probably don't play it with the addition of starter deck 12 mihawk with the addition of E1 Sanji just cuts out a lot of those cards in this to give the UTA slider Advantage but we'll have to wait and see especially with these five cards I think both players Mulligan so they got to keep these hands they're going to keep these hands from us as long as they can it seems like in this game so looking at this five life each overall I'm excited to see this one it looks like the kakur has a couple flumes in their hand so some 2K counters to work with as always nice we'll see what they have I'm curious to look it looks like the uh UTA has the thre drop UTA blocker four cost Zoro the three cost mihawk which we saw in the top four match which is really good in the eight cost kid along with the seven drop Luffy the kakuri has two flampe a Neko mamushi and okiku and a gatsu so honestly not the greatest of hands I feel like you definitely want on your second turn to play the peros faroh and swing for seven at lead but with the okiku the okiku might be nice with that on KO effect cuz unlike the sakazuki matchup UTA doesn't necessarily have any bottom decking events and effects so if anything they just have like backlight we know that backlight is in this list I think we saw in a previous round so here we go the national championships Japan one piece TCG the first E1 event a one da and pass for the Uta no new Genesis in the hand so the katakuri is going to top deck another gatu so it's just going to be a draw and pass likewise to them and I'm Invincible comes to hand that is a great card to find early because the UTA we have seen it time and time again has been so strong with this and so swinging five at lead they're probably going to play this dracu mihawk to be able to get the Zoro on the field because I think the Zoro is a slash attribute going to instead of the mihawk actually play the UTA so maybe saving the mihawk for next turn maybe attempting to block one of the swings or maybe just going to take the life and then the UTA is going to restand the character that the mihawk rests so could be interesting now because you know at for Dawn there's no gatu that's going to come down on this play so your UTA is pretty much safe so going to be taking that life it's going to be a Nami and the okiku is going to come down and pass the turn that okiku a 6K body so strong with that enko effect makes it so annoying for your opponent another kid is coming out in that draw and going to be attaching the one and Swinging six going to be revealing a monkey day Luffy blocker so going to put that in hand and we'll see where this kak Curry decides to do with it they do have to counter 2K which they do have that flampe and a Capone bej honestly I would rather do the flampe to not give any information about how many bejs have been seen uh but that's just me but maybe it actually doesn't matter in the long run but the UTA is going to play that Nami right there and use that Nami effect to grab a film card so they can grab the Sanji or the Brooke opting for the Sanji the Sanji is a 2K counter they have several non-c counter cards in their hand with the uh kids and the Luffy and also that I'm invincible so probably just grabbing that Sanji to pitch in the coming turn since they know that in o is going to swing and also a kak curry so now at 6 Dawn at this point going to be attaching one and Swinging seven at lead going to be looking at their life it's a stor keep on top definitely going to like that on play effect when it does become active they did get a 10 drop big mom in this game so actually putting the sator at the bottom that's interesting and so taking this life going to be an us op the Usopp is nice and playing that gatu to get rid of the Nami the Nami you don't want to swing to give any more searches so going to be swinging six at life and going to be I think another blocker kid so three blocker kids in the hand three dead cards for at least the next turn so going to be top decking the Nami right there and going to be swinging five off of the leader so swinging five at lead not a lot of cards in hand only four so going to be taking this life we don't know what it is and it's going to be a 2K amond that's nice they're really building up the 2K counters in hand and going to be resting all their Dawn on seven to play the Luffy I forgot the name of it for a second and then the Nami I'm forgetting all the names all of a sudden but anyways I've been doing a lot of casting if you didn't see the playlist but only going to be able to play two characters but that might be enough to what you need to continue to advance and apply pressure in this game and so now at the 8 Dawn term the kakur probably playing uh maybe another good datsu in this one you do have six in total on the uh life totals between you and your opponent so it wouldn't surprise me actually to see five rested Dawn for a gatu to pop the Nami again basically make the Nami a wasted card not being able to search at all because we saw that they rested seven and uh we saw that they rested seven so when they laid down that Nami they couldn't use the onplay effect to search and so that okiku swinging and taking a life going to be that UTA blocker there I'm really in the camp of popping this Nami right here you continue to apply a pressure you can attach more Dawn to your katakuri and then swing I think eight if if my math is correct 1 2 3 four five so you would actually have three Dawn to put if you wanted to so maybe even thinking about potentially doing the okiku because they have another okiku in hand and then slotting some Dawn between the gatu that they have on field already and the kakuri that's the other option that you could probably go here you can't play the T drop mom until next turn but honestly the tend drop mom they've been taking so much life that they're getting all of these cards none of them going to the bin and so looking at that life swinging seven at leader going to be finding a 200 million Vol amaru and putting it at the bottom so the UTA player just taking life left and right going to put five now I'm sorry going to put three on the gatu and block with the UTA here to save some space and then playing that okiku putting for it's looking pretty good for the kakuri I'm not going to lie top decking that Zoro but a lot of cards in hand and so first they're going to swing five it doesn't look like that they're going to uh use the Nami effect so going to be playing that UTA and Swinging with lead at the life going to be putting that in hand it's another 10 drop big mom oh my gosh and so we know that the last two life are Satori and two million volts ofar for the katakuri so they're going to swing with the Luffy oh my gosh they're going to swing with the Luffy right here this is super surprising I wonder if they're going to play the eight Drop Kid and so that seven swing is going to take a life it's going to be a 200 million volt tomaru so the life is 200 million volt tomaru Satori and 200 million volt tomaru they're going to take it and not do anything within maybe thinking that another blocker is going to come in but they're gonna play that kid there they're going to rest the kid to play a thre drop character it's going to be another UTA blocker and attach one Dawn so it's a basically an extra blocker and then trash the I'm Invincible event to bring up this Luffy so a great job by the UTA to utilize the Luffy and swing with it to be able to then use kid and reand very very good stuff going on and now the tend big mom is not going to trash any more of your life so definitely something I think that the uh UTA player planned on if I had to take a guess I bet if they did like a postgame interview and I was able to understand every single word in Japanese that they said I bet they would probably if asked say that they wanted to take a ton of Life early and just stack blockers so then the big mom doesn't get as much of an effect on on the game plan and they get to keep all of those cards so thinking about what they want to do now with all tend Dawn it's still likely that we could see that tend drop big mom thinking about what they want to do now I think the 10 mom could be good because you get the life but here's the problem with the kid if you do lay down that 10 mom you're not going to be able to swing at all and apply any pressure whatsoever so I think the katakuri is thinking about just utilizing the dawn here so with four Dawn attached going to be swinging nine at the kid we do know that there's that Sanji in hand but it looks like they're going to pitch that they were thinking about the Zoro and oh no it's going to be 10 I'm sorry because they looked at the top of their life that's correct yes so they needed 3K counters in order to save the kid cuz remember this eight drop kit is so strong because it says if it's rested with one Dawn attach your opponent has to swing at that and nothing else as long as that character has one Dawn and is rested on the field so the okiku getting three Dawn and becoming a 9,000 power swing at the kid going to need a 2K to get out of that and they do and so another nine is going to come to the okiku going to need 2,000 power more so could be two Usopp uh could be Usopp Zoro right there and they're going to block they're going to keep that kid in the field so now on tendon moving into their turn they've got two life three swings that they need to hit from this field they did draw what I think is backlight that's the alternate art of the backlight so that could be effective if there's a sji in trigger we know there's not going to be but they don't know that and so using the Nami effect swinging five at lead going to be grabbing a brook and countering out of it with that 2K going to be attaching one to the UTA and using UTA effect as she swings six to grab a 2K counter the 2K counter is really really good right here in preparing for your next turn I wonder now cuz if you put another kid down you can't get the nine onto it on unfortunately so might not be the best thing ever cuz you do want to attach one to this kid right here and swing so swinging at life going to be taking a hit and now an indirect BR or blocker as well going to be the sator but they don't play the Satori and so using the rest of their seven Dawn to play Luffy they could play Zoro right here as the other card Zoro would be stronger than Usopp as a character but could also no they don't have a Sanji anymore in hand I was going to say Sanji could be really really good in this but it looks like they're going to opt towards that Zoro I think Zoro is the best option because if you do want to play one and get rid of a counter that has the most attack to apply the most pressure so for a board that originally looks like it was in kak Curry's favor it is quickly become in uta's favor this game has swayed entirely because because of that eight Drop Kid and if you didn't have your eight drop kids before this tournament aired well good luck having or getting them at a cheap price after this tournament airs I bet they Spike up a ton again and so looking at this it's all 10 life right here and in the same situation as before that kid completely negates the T drop big mom because if they play the tend drop big mom this turn they basically lose overall in the game so you have to commit all of this Dawn and the way that the math worked is you have to commit the dawn the same exact way not advancing your board State unless this guy goes down so swinging 10 right here once again going to be a 2K and a 1K coming out going to try to like draw as many swings as possible and so thinking about what they want to do right here the uh going to be attach catching two Dawn and Swinging eight at the kid now swinging minimums for onek counter is going to be countering out of all of that and now the blocker goes on so saving the kid some people may say all right yeah you can have the kid but the kid is 1,000 power more than the Luffy so taking the Luffy a really really good game plan overall they top Tech in UT blocker so could be actually really really nice in this one to be able to swing with that monkey deffy if you don't get game and lethal right here to be able to restand it and potentially survive another another turn which is crazy to think about so going to be swinging that kid into life and they're going to take it it's going to be that 200 million volts Maru I would consider trashing the both of the big bombs but leaving one and getting a new life so this kind of changes your game plan a little bit but I think you're still feeling decent about your odds the kak curry does have some counter in hand with 200 million volts or I'm sorry not 200 million volts tomaru that you're the one that should disappear event the Satori the flampe as well so that's uh what is a quick m 7,000 counter overall if they just get out of a couple swings depending on how they swing and it looks like they may go the more passive route I think so using the you're the one that should disappear get rid of that 10 drop big mom the Luffy is probably going to get resanded at the end of the turn by the UTA if I had to take a guess discarding that backlight to use the UTA blocker effect and so leaving one Dawn open right now now curious as to why they're leaving one Dawn open I think you're fine kind of attaching a lot of this Dawn to these characters because you want to force two cards out of their hand right so putting eight on this UTA could be really really good for your game plan I don't even know if you want a Nami search at this point you attach three to the um or just attaching one so swinging seven and with the Zoro at the katakuri this is again like I mentioned going to force two cards out of their hand so going to be two 2K blockers only one card left this seven swing that could come in eight swing don't think about it too hard it's just one card in their hand it's just one card just swing seven that's all you need to do and so swinging seven with this Nami and using the effect to look at their cards could be looking for an I'm Invincible re stand but going to be finding a new genesis the new genesis would be able to continue drawing and so this life is going to be a Satori and they're going to attach all the rest of the Dawn and that's it that's the game the UTA is the champion of Japan Nationals eo1 comes out gives them the Sanji and that's all they needed to win this one the first eo1 Champion I don't think anybody could have called it to be honest I didn't see UTA on anybody's tier list above tier three so UTA an excellent call for this event I would say did I mean just really aggressive I mean these games were quick I feel like for a lot of these matches so excellent excellent job by our players for winning the event suku Sagi is I believe their name that is the champion so congratulations to them and then siroko also the second place Champion the deck lists are public so if you want to check out the deck list from this event make sure to go to our Discord server it's in the description the link over there it'll be in the one piece section of the Discord server I'll post a link to the lists in there because I know some of our people in our server may be really excited about the UT list and I hope you are too cuz I am for sure thank you again so much for watching also if you would like to here they did announce I don't know exactly when but they did announce right here that there is going to after the World Championships going to be a ban and a restriction in the one piece card game that will be announced now this will be just for Japan I think we'll see if the rest of the the world follow suit since we are a little bit behind in the format but let me know your comments as well and expect a video of some speculation and my thoughts on the meta and what would be best or most likely to get the ringer in terms of this updated ban and restriction list so thank you again so much for watching hope you enjoyed this video check out the other uh ones in the playlist from this event to get all the commentary and all the gameplay that you want on this channel and uh yeah hope to see you again soon\",\n",
