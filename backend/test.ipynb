If card effects require a player to rest a card and set it as active simultaneously, the \\neffect requiring the player to rest the card always takes precedence. \\n1-3-10. Cost and Activation Cost \\n1-3-10-1. Cost refers to a payment that must be made to play a card. A card’s cost is \\nthe number written in its upper left corner. (See 6-5-3-1.) \\n1-3-10-2. Activation cost refers to a payment required to activate a card’s effect. (See \\n8-3.) \\n1-3-11. If both players are instructed to perform some action at the same time according \\nto a card ’s effect, the turn player is to perform the action first, followed by the \\nnon-turn player.\\n\\n5. Game Setup \\n5-1. Preparing Leader Cards, Decks, and DON!! Decks \\n5-1-1. Each player prepares a Leader card, deck, and DON!! deck from their cards before \\nthe game begins. \\n5-1-2. Each player needs  exactly 1 Leader card, a 50 -card deck, and a 10-card DON!! \\ndeck to play. \\n5-1-2-1. A deck is a bundle of cards made up of Character cards, Event cards, and Stage \\ncards. \\n5-1-2-2. Only cards of a color included on the Leader card can be included in a deck. \\nCards of a color not included on the Leader card cannot be added to the deck.  \\n5-1-2-3. A deck can contain no more than 4 cards with the same card number. \\n5-1-2-4. Effects related to deck construction rules are treated as permanent effects (see \\n8-1-3-4-3.) which replace the deck construction rules above. \\n5-1-2-4-1. Effects related to deck construction are those specifying that the deck can \\ncontain a specified number of cards of a certain category, or that the deck\\n\\nDON!! cards such that the number of DON!! cards given to it is X or higher. \\n10-2-10. DON!! −X \\n10-2-10-1. “DON!! −X” is a keyword indicating a condition requiring you to select \\na total number of DON!! cards equal to the value of X from your Leader \\narea, Character area, and cost area, and return them to your DON!! deck. \\n10-2-11. [Your Turn] \\n10-2-11-1. [Your Turn] is a keyword  indicating a condition that is satisfied during \\nyour turn.  \\n10-2-12. [Opponent’s Turn] \\n10-2-12-1. [Opponent’s Turn] is a keyword indicating a condition that is satisfied \\nduring your opponent’s turn. \\n10-2-13. [Once Per Turn] \\n10-2-13-1. [Once Per Turn] is a keyword indicating an effect can only be activated \\nand resolved once during that turn. \\n10-2-13-2. Where there are multiple cards with the same effect, [Once Per Turn]\\n\\nCharacter card in the cost area such that it remains visible . This is called \\n“giving”.  \\n6-5-5-2. Leader cards and Character cards gain 1000 power during your turn for each \\nDON!! card given to them. \\n6-5-5-3. Giving can be performed as many times as you wish to the extent possible. \\n6-5-5-4. When a card that has been given a DON!! card is moved to another area, all \\nDON!! cards given to that card are placed in the cost area and rested. \\n6-5-6. Battle \\n6-5-6-1. Neither player can battle on their first turn. \\n6-5-6-2. For more information on battles, please refer to “7. Card Attacks and Battles” \\nbelow. \\n6-6. End Phase \\n6-6-1. This is the phase in which various end-of-turn processes are carried out. \\n6-6-1-1. Auto effects that read “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) and “[End of Your \\nOpponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) are activated. \\n6-6-1-1-1. Auto effects that read “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) and “[End of \\nYour Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) can only be activated and resolved once. \\n6-6-1-1-2. After all “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) effects have been activated \\nand resolved, all “[End of Your Opponent’s Turn]”  (Keyword) effects are \\nactivated and resolved. \\n6-6-1-1-3. If there are multiple “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) effects to be \\nresolved, the turn player may activate and resolve them in any order. \\n6-6-1-1-4. If there are multiple “[End of Your Opponent’s Turn]”  (Keyword) \\neffects to be resolved, the non-turn player may activate and resolve them in \\nany order.\\n\\n2-7-3. When activating an Event card from your hand, you should first reveal the card \\nyou wish to activate, select a number of active DON!! cards in your cost area equal \\nto the card’s cost, rest those DON!! cards, and then trash the revealed card to \\nactivate it. \\n2-7-4. When playing a Stage card from your hand, you should first reveal the card you \\nwish to play, select a number of active DON!! cards in your cost area equal to the \\ncard’s cost, rest those DON!! cards, and then play the revealed card. \\n2-7-5. Only Character cards, Event cards and Stage cards have costs. \\n2-7-6. An effect may make a cost greater or less than the written value. \\n2-8. Card Text \\n2-8-1. This describes the card’s effects. \\n2-8-2. Unless otherwise specified, card text on Leader cards, Character cards, and Stage \\ncards is valid only in the Leader area, Character area, and Stage area, respectively. \\n2-8-3. Text is resolved in order starting from the text closest to the top. \\n2-8-4. Some text has detailed explanations of keyword effects or other card effects inside \\n( ) parentheses. These are called explanatory notes and their purpose is to provide \\nfurther explanation of effects.\""

Use Otama to Weaken a Nami\\n- Play Otama (cost 1 DON!!), target one of your opponent’s Namis, reducing it to 3000 power for the turn.\\n\\n### 2. Activate Nico Robin’s Effect\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to Nico Robin (to enable her [When Attacking] effect and boost her to 5000 power if Zoro Leader’s effect is active).\\n- Attack with Nico Robin, targeting the weakened Nami. When you attack, activate her effect to K.O. that Nami (since it is now 3000 power).\\n- Your opponent may use counter cards to save Nami, but if not, you remove one Nami from the board.\\n\\n### 3. Power Up Your Board\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to your Leader Zoro to activate his effect ([DON!! x1] [Your Turn] All of your Characters gain +1000 power).\\n- Now, all your Characters (including the new Otama) get +1000 power for the turn.\\n\\n### 4. Attack with Roronoa Zoro (OP01-025, Rush)\\n- Attach 1 or more DON!! to Zoro (OP01-025) to increase his power. With Leader’s effect, he is at 6000 with 1 DON!!, 7000 with 2, etc.\\n- Attack your opponent’s Leader or another Nami, depending on your goal (apply pressure to life or clear board).\\n- If you want to clear another Nami, you can play a second Otama (cost 1 DON!!), target another Nami, and attack it with Zoro (OP01-025) or Marco.\\n\\n### 5. Attack with Marco\\n- Attach 1 or more DON!! to Marco to boost his power (with Leader’s effect).\\n- Attack the opponent’s Leader or a weakened Nami.\\n\\n### 6. Consider Playing a Second Marco\\n- If you want more board presence, you can play another Marco from hand (cost 3 DON!!), but this will use up more DON!! and may limit your attacks this turn.\\n\\n### 7. Reserve Otama for Defense\\n- You may want to keep at least one Otama in hand for its 2000 counter value, especially since your opponent may attack back strongly next turn.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example Turn Sequence\\n\\n1. Play Otama (1 DON!!, 6 left), target Nami #1 (now 3000 power).\\n2. Attach 1 DON!! to Nico Robin (5 left), attack Nami #1, K.O. it with her effect.\\n3. Attach 1 DON!! to Leader Zoro (4 left), all Characters get +1000 power.\\n4. Attach 1 DON!! to Roronoa Zoro (OP01-025) (3 left), attack Nami #2 (if you want to clear board) or the opponent’s Leader (now 7000 power with Leader effect).\\n   - If attacking Nami #2, play a second Otama (1 DON!!, 2 left), target Nami #2 (now 3000 power), attack and K.O. it.\\n5. Attach 1 DON!! to Marco (1 left), attack with Marco (now 7000 power with Leader effect).\\n6. Use remaining DON!! as needed for more attacks or to play another Character.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n- Use Otama + Nico Robin to remove a Nami.\\n- Use Leader’s effect to boost your board.\\n- Attack with your Characters, prioritizing board control or pressuring the opponent’s life.\\n- Consider keeping Otama in hand for defense.\\n\\nLet me know if you want a more aggressive or defensive plan, or if you want to focus on attacking the opponent’s Leader instead of clearing their board!'}]}, goto='END')"

Activate Leader Ability\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to your Leader (Roronoa Zoro OP01-001).\\n- All your Characters gain +1000 power this turn (Zoro: 6000, Nico Robin: 5000, Marco: 6000, [Rush] Zoro: 6000).\\n\\n### 2. Plan Your Attacks\\n- All your Characters are now at least 5000/6000 power, which matches or exceeds the opponent’s Namis and Leader.\\n- You can attack the opponent’s Leader or try to clear their board. However, since all Namis are 5000 power, Nico Robin’s effect alone cannot K.O. them unless you reduce their power.\\n\\n#### Option: Use Otama + Nico Robin\\n- Play Otama from hand (cost 1 DON!!), target one Nami, reducing her to 3000 power.\\n- Attack with Nico Robin, attach 1 DON!! to her (to activate her effect and boost her to 6000 power with Leader’s ability).\\n- On attack, use Nico Robin’s effect to K.O. the weakened Nami (now 3000 power).\\n- You can then choose to attack the opponent’s Leader or other Namis with your remaining Characters.\\n\\n### 3. Attack Sequence Example\\n\\n#### a) Play Otama (cost 1 DON!!)\\n- 6 DON!! left.\\n- Target one Nami, reduce her to 3000 power.\\n\\n#### b) Attack with Nico Robin\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to Nico Robin (5 DON!! left).\\n- Nico Robin is now 5000 base + 1000 (Leader) + 1000 (DON!!) = 7000 power.\\n- Attack the Nami you weakened with Otama.\\n- Use Nico Robin’s effect to K.O. that Nami.\\n\\n#### c) Attack with [Rush] Zoro\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to [Rush] Zoro (4 DON!! left).\\n- [Rush] Zoro is now 5000 base + 1000 (Leader) + 1000 (DON!!) = 7000 power.\\n- Attack the opponent’s Leader for 1 damage (they may counter, but you force them to use resources).\\n\\n#### d) Attack with Marco\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to Marco (3 DON!! left).\\n- Marco is now 5000 base + 1000 (Leader) + 1000 (DON!!) = 7000 power.\\n- Attack the opponent’s Leader for 1 damage.\\n\\n#### e) Attack with Leader\\n- Attach 1 more DON!! to Leader (2 DON!! left).\\n- Leader is now 5000 base + 1000 (DON!!) = 6000 power.\\n- Attack the opponent’s Leader for 1 damage.\\n\\n#### f) Remaining DON!!\\n- You have 2 DON!! left. You can:\\n  - Play another Otama (if you want to set up for next turn or block with counter).\\n  - Hold for countering during your opponent’s turn.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary of Actions\\n\\n1. Play Otama, reduce a Nami to 3000 power.\\n2. Attack that Nami with Nico Robin (with 1 DON!!), K.O. it.\\n3. Attack with [Rush] Zoro (with 1 DON!!) at the opponent’s Leader.\\n4. Attack with Marco (with 1 DON!!) at the opponent’s Leader.\\n5. Attack with your Leader (with 1 DON!!) at the opponent’s Leader.\\n6. Use remaining DON!! as you see fit (play another Otama, or keep for counter).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why This Is Strong\\n\\n- You remove one of their Namis, reducing their board pressure.\\n- You apply significant pressure to their Leader, possibly forcing them to use counter cards from hand.\\n- You maintain a strong board and keep Otama and counter cards in hand for defense.\\n\\nIf you want to be more aggressive, you can use more DON!! to boost attacks, but always consider keeping some for countering on your opponent’s turn.\\n\\nLet me know if you want a more defensive or aggressive plan, or if you want to focus on clearing the board instead of attacking the Leader!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1227, 'prompt_tokens': 13389, 'total_tokens': 14616, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 2688}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_51e1070cf2', 'id': 'chatcmpl-C2168JXXDaqgVC6ce3SSw13Kv8rFN', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--8a440eae-d640-4496-851e-82478b68242e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13389, 'output_tokens': 1227, 'total_tokens': 14616, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 2688}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]"

This means your opponent can attack twice with their Leader, potentially putting more pressure on your Life or Characters.\\n\\n2. Opponent’s Board (Triple Nami):  \\nYour opponent has three Nami (OP02-036), each with 5000 power. While their ability is mainly for searching {FILM} cards, they can still attack and pressure your Life or Characters. Be cautious if your Life is low or if you have vulnerable Characters.\\n\\n3. Opponent’s DON!! Advantage:  \\nYour opponent has 8 DON!! available, giving them flexibility to power up attacks, use abilities, or play Events. Watch for potential power boosts or defensive Events during your attacks.\\n\\n4. Your Board State:  \\nYou have strong attackers (Zoro Leader, Zoro Character with Rush, Nico Robin, Marco). However, be mindful of overextending, as green decks can have removal or counterplay.\\n\\n5. Nico Robin’s Ability:  \\nIf you attack with Nico Robin and use her ability, you can potentially KO one of the opponent’s Namis (if they have 3000 power or less, but currently they are at 5000). Consider if you can reduce their power or if you should focus on attacking Life.\\n\\nSummary:  \\nBe wary of Kid’s double attack, the potential for multiple Nami attacks, and the opponent’s high DON!! count for counterplay. Plan your attacks carefully and consider holding back a blocker or counter if you expect a strong counterattack next turn.'"

    "'Here are the main things you should be wary of in the current game state:\\n\\n1. **Eustass \"Captain\" Kid Leader Ability**: Your opponent\\'s leader can, once per turn, rest 3 DON!! and trash a card from their hand to set their Leader as active. This means Kid can attack twice in a turn, or attack and then be ready to block or threaten another attack. Be careful not to leave yourself open to multiple attacks, especially if you are low on life.\\n\\n2. **Multiple Nami (OP02-036) Characters**: Your opponent has three Nami (OP02-036) on the field. Each Nami can, when attacking (by resting 1 DON!!), look at the top 3 cards of their deck and add a {FILM} card (other than Nami) to their hand. This can quickly refill their hand and give them access to powerful {FILM} cards, including events or characters that could swing the game.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Multiple Attacks**: With three Nami and Kid, your opponent can attack multiple times in a turn. Even though Nami\\'s power is only 5000, if you are not careful, you could lose several life in one turn, especially if you cannot block or counter enough attacks.\\n\\n4. **Trigger Effects**: When you take damage, remember that your opponent may be trying to push you into activating a [Trigger] effect from your life cards. Be aware of what triggers you have in your deck and how they might affect the game state.\\n\\n5. **Hand Size and Resources**: With Nami\\'s effect, your opponent can increase their hand size and find key cards. If you let them keep all three Nami on the field, they will have a significant resource advantage over time.\\n\\n**Strategic Advice:**\\n- Try to remove at least one or more Nami if possible, to slow down your opponent\\'s card advantage.\\n- Be cautious about overextending, as Kid\\'s double attack can quickly deplete your life.\\n- Plan your counters and blockers carefully, especially if you expect a big turn from your opponent.\\n- Watch your own hand size and resources, as you may need to defend against multiple attacks in a single turn.\\n\\nIf you have any removal or ways to disrupt your opponent\\'s board, now is a good time to use them!'\n"

During the Main Phase, the turn player can rest an active Leader card in their Leader \\narea, or an active Character card in their Character area, to attack an opponent’s Leader \\ncard in their Leader area, or rested Character card in their Character area. When an \\nattack is made, the game proceeds to Battle (see 6-5-6.) and is processed in order from \\nthe Attack Step (see 7-1-1.) to the Damage Step (see 7-1-4.). \\n7-1-1. Attack Step \\n7-1-1-1. Attacks are carried out by the Leader card, or a Character card in the \\nCharacter area. First,  the turn player  declares their attack by resting their  \\nactive Leader card or 1 active Character card. \\n7-1-1-2. The turn player then selects the target of their attack. The target can be either \\nthe opponent’s Leader card or 1 of their rested Character cards in their \\nCharacter area. \\n7-1-1-3. Effects that read [When Attacking] , “when you attack ”, or [On Your \\nOpponent's Attack] activate. \\n7-1-1-4. If, at the end of the Attack Step, the attacking card or the target card for the \\nattack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Block Step \\n(see 7-1-2.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.). \\n7-1-2. Block Step \\n7-1-2-1. The player being attacked can activate the [Blocker] effect of their card only \\nonce during that battle. \\n7-1-2-2. When a [Blocker] is activated, effects that read [On Block] or “when you block” \\nactivate.\\n\\nevent occurs, follow the procedure below. \\n11-1-1-1. If neither player can stop an infinite loop, the game ends in a draw. \\n11-1-1-2. If only one player has the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop \\naction, that player declares how many times they wish to carry out the loop \\naction. Carry out the loop action that many times and finish it at a timing \\nwhen that player can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player cannot \\nchoose to restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all \\ncards in all areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to \\ndo so. \\n11-1-1-3. If both players have the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop action, \\nthe turn player first decides how many times they wish to carry out the loop \\naction. Next, the non-turn player decides how many times they wish to carry \\nout the loop action. Carry out the loop action the fewer of these two times \\nand finish it at a timing when the player  who chose the fewer of these two \\ntimes can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player s cannot  choose to \\nrestart the loop even if the game is in exa ctly the same state (all cards in all \\nareas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to do so. \\n11-2. Revealing Cards \\n11-2-1. When a card is required to be moved from one secret area to another secret area, \\nsuch as “Add Monkey.D.Luffy from your deck to your hand”, the card being\\n\\n(see 7-1-3.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.). \\n7-1-3. Counter Step \\n7-1-3-1. Effects of the player being attacked that read “when attacked” activate. \\n7-1-3-2. The player being attacked may perform the following actions in any order and \\nas many times as they wish: \\n7-1-3-2-1. Activate [(Symbol) Counter ]: The player being attacked may trash a \\nCharacter card with  [(Symbol) Counter] from their hand to activate an \\neffect that increases the power of their Leader or 1 Character card by the \\nvalue of the [(Symbol) Counter] during that battle. \\n7-1-3-2-2. Activate an Event card: The player being attacked may pay the cost of an \\nEvent card with [Counter] in their hand, and then trash it to activate the \\n[Counter] effect. \\n7-1-2-3.

       "  AIMessage(content='Here’s how you should approach attacking your opponent, based on the rules and your current board:\\n\\n1. **Assess Your Board and Opponent’s Board:**\\n   - You have three Characters (Roronoa Zoro [Rush], Nico Robin, Marco) and your Leader (Roronoa Zoro).\\n   - Your opponent has three Nami (all 5000 power) and their Leader (Eustass \"Captain\" Kid).\\n   - None of your opponent’s Characters have [Blocker], so you can attack their Leader directly or attack their rested Characters (if any).\\n\\n2. **Maximize Your Power:**\\n   - Attach 1 DON!! to your Leader to activate Roronoa Zoro’s ability: all your Characters gain +1000 power this turn.\\n   - You can also attach additional DON!! to your Characters to further boost their power for attacks.\\n\\n3. **Attack Sequence Recommendation:**\\n   - **Attack with Characters first:** Use your Characters to attack the opponent’s Leader. Since all your Characters will have at least 6000 power (with Zoro’s ability and 1 DON!! each), they will be strong enough to pressure the opponent’s hand or life.\\n   - **Use Roronoa Zoro [Rush]:** This card can attack the turn it is played. Use it to attack the Leader for immediate pressure.\\n   - **Nico Robin’s effect:** Her [When Attacking] effect only works on Characters with 3000 power or less, but all opponent’s Characters are 5000, so this effect won’t be useful right now.\\n   - **Attack with your Leader:** After attacking with your Characters, attack with your Leader as well.\\n\\n4. **Target Selection:**\\n   - Since your opponent’s Nami are all 5000 power and not rested (unless they attacked last turn), you can only attack their Leader directly.\\n   - If your opponent rests a Nami to attack or use its effect, you could attack and potentially KO it on your next turn.\\n\\n5. **DON!! Management:**\\n   - You have 7 DON!! available. Distribute them to maximize your attacks:\\n     - 1 DON!! to your Leader (to activate the ability).\\n     - 1 DON!! each to your Characters to boost their power.\\n     - Any remaining DON!! can be used to further boost attacks or play cards from your hand.\\n\\n6. **Goal:**\\n   - Try to deal as much damage to the opponent’s Leader as possible, reducing their life and forcing them to use cards from their hand to defend.\\n\\n**Summary of Attack Steps:**\\n- Attach 1 DON!! to your Leader to activate the ability.\\n- Attach DON!! to your Characters to boost their power.\\n- Attack the opponent’s Leader with your Characters and Leader in any order.\\n- If you have cards in hand to play, consider playing more Characters to increase your board presence.\\n\\nIf you want a more detailed, card-by-card attack plan, let me know how many cards you have in hand and if you want to play any new cards this turn!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 633, 'prompt_tokens': 4210, 'total_tokens': 4843, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 2944}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_799e4ca3f1', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BwxY4NxVAWmPRKQaK4H5MlHITRsJA', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='RulebookAgent', id='run--4d8316a6-a3f5-4efe-b630-7e3def98247f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4210, 'output_tokens': 633, 'total_tokens': 4843, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 2944}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}"
